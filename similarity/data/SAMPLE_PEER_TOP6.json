Your can find your Research Finance Administrator at Nigel Titchener-Hooker leads the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacture in Emergent Macromolecular Therapies and was the past lead of the UCL Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre (IMRC) in Bioprocessing programme. This involves a multidisciplinary group from over a dozen departments to research new methods to speed the development of efficient and robust processes for the manufacture of the next generations of macromolecular drugs. The work brings together researchers from Structural and Molecular Biology (Professor John Ward), and within the Faculty of Engineering Science significant collaborations exist with Computer Science (Professor Tony Hunter), Chemical Engineering (Dr. Eva Sorenson and Dr. Lazaros Papageorgiou). Internally Dr. Dan Bracewell, Dr. Nicolas Szita, Dr. Yuhong Zhou, Dr. Eli Keshavarz-Moore and Professor Mike Hoare help Nigel in the management of the IMRC consortium that comprises 15 leading national and international companies. A major focus of Nigel\u2019s work is the creation of whole bioprocess models and the use of these to gain process insights and understanding. Here he works with Dr. Yuhong Zhou in the creation of graphical user interfaces to visualise better process trade offs. With Dr. Suzanne Farid, Nigel has pioneered studies of decisional tools addressing the interface between bioprocessing and business issues. In line with the theme of whole bioprocess modelling, Nigel has collaborated with colleagues at Newcastle University (Professor Gary Montague, Professor Elaine Martin and Dr. Jarka Glassey) to create new ways of improving the performance of manufacturing processes by combining IMRC tools with agent-based methods. Nigel chairs the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Bioprocess Leadership activity now directed by Prof Gary Lye. Since its inception the EngD programme has attracted over 60 sponsor companies to date and nearly 100 projects have been funded under this mechanism which complements the research within the Department. Funding for the above research has come from the UK EPSRC, the TSB Technology Programme and a range of company collaborators. Nigel has held consultancies with a broad range of international companies and serves on the editorial board of key peer-reviewed journals. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2008 in recognition of his pioneering work on biopharmaceuticals manufacturing. He is a Fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and was awarded the Donal Medal for hsi contributions to Biochemical Engineering in 2013. He is Chair of the Board of the prestigious ACS-supported Recovery of Biological Products conference series. Nigel\u2019s current teaching portfolio extends across all of the department\u2019s programmes and include a major emphasis on Integrated Downstream Processing, Fluid Flow Fundamentals and Materials of Construction. He teaches on aspects of primary recovery and chromatographic purification.","2":"Dr. Love\u2019s research group works to increase knowledge of the kinetics and thermodynamics associated with gel and aggregate formation. The group\u2019s work is loosely organized on three themes: the physics of gelation of immobolization matrices for both cells and therapeutics, the evolving structural evolution of amyloid proteins induced gels and aggregates, and the linkages among mechanical manipulation of cells, cell constructs, and immobolized cells. Our primary analytical tools include rheometry, DSC, and x-ray scattering. We have also built our own mechanical probes for microtiter plates in both compression and shear and are developing alternative mathematical models to describe biophysical changes arising during gelation. Functionally, we are formulating fluid dispersions deployed as injectables for localized and fixed drug delivery systems, benign cellular immobilization matrices for tissue engineering, and probing the biophysics of protein aggregation. Our development of benign cellular immobilization matrices offers hope of a platform technology that could be used with different cells.","3":"NPC is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. We aim to define key molecular events involved in the malignant transformation of nasopharyngeal epithelial cells and the role of EBV infection in NPC pathogenesis. A panel of telomerase-immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell lines has been established as premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cell models for EBV infection study. The essential genetic and cellular events involved in transformation of these EBV-infected premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelium are under investigation using state-of-start molecular and cellular platforms. The functional interactions of EBV-encoded oncogenes and signaling events driving the malignant transformation of premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells are key directions of investigation. The oncogenic potential of EBV genes and their effects on cell signaling mechanisms in infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells leading to deregulation of cell growth, escape from senescence, resistance to apoptosis, invasive properties and other malignant properties are under investigation. NPC is closely association with EBV infection. EBV infection of primary B cells drives their transformation into proliferative lymphoblastoid cell lines. In contrast, EBV infection of primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells induce growth arrest. EBV infection of normal pharyngeal epithelial cells are believed to be lytic in nature contributing to the generation of infectious EBV for transmission in saliva. In NPC cells, EBV infection is latent in nature. The establishment of latent infection in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells may represent an early and essential step in NPC pathogenesis. Using the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell models and new EBV+ve NPC cell lines established in our laboratory, we are defining the key events involved in the establishment of latent EBV infection in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. Elucidation of events leading to latent infection of EBV in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells may reveal novel targets for prevention and treatment of NPC. The molecular and cellular events underlying invasion of cancer are investigated using both molecular and live cell imaging techniques. The roles of EBV-encoded genes and EBV infection in modifying the invasive behavior of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells are under current investigation.

Palaeolimnological assessment of lake acidification and environmental change in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, Alberta. Journal of Limnology, 69, 92-104. My principal research interests concern environmental change in aquatic ecosystems specializing in limnology and palaeolimnology. My main specialist group of organisms is freshwater diatoms: their ecology and taxonomy. Research Projects include: Sediment records of environmental change in Lake Baikal (Siberia) Leverhulme, NERC and Darwin Initiative Projects 1991-1999. Diatom taxonomy and ecology of the Falkland Islands (FCO OTs project 2001-2003), Coordinator of the CASSARINA Project (EU 4th Framework INCO Programme 1996-1999. Coordinator of the MELMARINA Project (EU 6th Framework INCO Programme 2002-2006. People and climate: sediment records in Lake Qarun, Egypt (Leverhulme Grant 2003-2006), Sediment records and environmental change in the Faiyum and Saqqara, Egypt (British Academy Grant 2007-2009) Project manager on various small grants including those from Scottish Natural Heritage, Countryside Council for Wales, DEFRA, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, The Royal Society. My research is inter-disciplinary and not only has influenced environmental change management in the UK and overseas but has also contributed significantly to the international scientific literature. In the UK I have contributed to the recognition of the widespread problem of freshwater acidification that arose in the 1980s. Research is on-going but the main body of research led to the recognition that atmospheric deposition of acid pollution from fossil fuel energy generation as the principal cause. In North Africa my research undertaken as part of the CASSARINA and MELMARINA projects led to the Tunisian Government\u2019s site descriptions of Ghar El Melh and Megene Chitane being listing as internationally important sites under the Ramsar Convention. During the course of my overseas research I have provided training for environmental scientists and management practitioners in partner organizations that has enhanced their capacity to manage inland waters. This has included hydro-ecological monitoring programme design and operation for environmental scientists in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. In Canada, my research (with C. Curtis) in the tar sands region lead to the realization that the tar sands oil extract methods were not causing widespread water acidification. IN Lake Baikal my studies of diatoms and recent environmental change indicated that water quality of this immense lake was not severely impaired by pollution in the 1990s."},"university":{"0":"UCL (University College London)","1":"UCL (University College London)","2":"University of Michigan","3":"The University of Hong Kong","4":"UCL (University College London)"},"keywords":{"0":"[Singapore, National University, Doctoral Researcher, Post, Singapore, Malaysia, Waste Recycling Production Network, Regional E, Informal Labour, Value\u2019, Waste, Aidan Wong, Germany, Green Party, Regional Development, Energy, Transport, Economic Affairs, Secretary, Emerging Market, Emergent Economic Geographies, Turkey, Tim Heinemann, Nottingham, University, Lecturer, Socialist Prague, Post, Space, Production, Social Exclusion, Expatriates, Golden City, Gilt, Andy Cook, networks, uneven development, economic geography, economy, interest, my areas, research, regional trajectories, Economic performance, A., Smith, M., Dunford, regional economies\u2019, labour, divisions, regions, commodities, value, Networks, D., Sadler, R., Hudson, J., Hardy, M., Dunford, A., Rainnie, A., Smith, industry\u2019, Slovak, outward processing, European integration, pan, regional transformations, industrial clusters, relations, A., Smith, production\u2019, Central, East, reconfiguration, regimes, European integration, R., Begg, J., Pickles, A., Smith, Bulgaria)\u2019, Haskovo, Italy, Romagna, Emilia, firms, chains, Industrial districts, A., Smith, J., P.

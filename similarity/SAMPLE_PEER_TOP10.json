I have published on nineteenth- and twentieth-century constructions of drink as a spatial problem, and on the parallels between historical and contemporary policy, popular and medical discussions of binge-drinking. Recently my interests have turned to temperance insurance, working with Dr Shaun French at the University of Nottingham. I was one of the organizers of ' I am a co-investigator on the \u2018Insuring healthcare in a digital world\u2019 project funded by a Wellcome Trust Seed Award within the Society And Ethics programme (\u00a334,068, 2015-16), with Liz McFall (OU, PI), and CIs Shaun French (Nottingham) and Zsuzsanna Vargha (Leicester). on the relationships between insurance and the histories and geographies of nineteenth and early twentieth-century climatology and meteorology. We've already given papers on this at the International Congress of History of Science Technology and Medicine (2013) and the British Association of Victorian Studies conference (2013 & 2014). The second area concerns literary geographies and representations of space, particularly in non-realist genres (science fiction, horror, ghost stories, utopias, etc). As well as editing with Rob Kitchin. I have written about William Gibson, H. P. Lovecraft, Iain M. Banks and Kim Stanley Robinson, and (briefly) Arthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood. I'm also interested in Maureen Duffy, M. John Harrison, and other writers. I developed some of this work through visits to the University of Tokyo in 2005 and 2007 as a visiting researcher. The first trip was funded by a \u00a512 million (~\u00a361,000) grant from the Japanese Ministry of Education for a four-year project on \u2018Utopia', working with Professors Tanji, Tanji, Yaguchi, Miyamoto Alvey, Tsuchida, and Hones at the Universities of Tokyo, Yokohama Kokuritsu and Hokkaido. . Intended as an interdisciplinary research resource, it has had nearly 14,000 views from 97 countries since the end of February 2012. I contributed written and verbal evidence on histories and geographies of drinking to the Parliamentary Health Select Committee in 2009. The Committee used a good deal of this material in its In terms of press interest, I've contributed to stories on drinking on TV (BBC Breakfast News) and radio programmes (\u2018Night Waves\u2019, Radio 3; \u2018The Long View\u2019, Radio 4; BBC local radio), and in print (the Various publics have encountered my work in other ways: a UCL Lunchtime Lecture, \u2018Those that don't drink, don't die so fast\u2019 (27 Nov 2012), on temperance and insurance, which can be seen .

Early Pleistocene human occupation at the edge of the boreal zone in northwest Europe. I am involved in a wide variety of teaching activities, ranging from lecture-based courses, to practical and field based teaching. I have led field classes to a variety of UK locations, mainly in upland environments and I have run the 1 year field class to the Cairngorms, Scotland for a number of years. These field courses have two main aims: to develop students\u2019 understanding of processes in the natural environment and to provide skills training through project work in preparation for independent projects. I currently teach on the following modules: My research focuses on geoarchaeology and the Palaeolithic record in Britain, with contributions to a number of research projects concerning the Palaeolithic archaeological record, particularly in Eastern England. is a 3 year, Leverhulme Trust funded project exploring the Palaeolithic record of the Breckland region of East Anglia. It will focus on the evidence for the earliest human presence in the area, the environment and lithic record of MIS 11 and the Lower\/Middle Palaeolithic transition. The project involves collaboration with the British Museum, Natural History Museum and the Mus\u00e9um National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle in Paris. project is continuing some of the work of the AHOB project, including on-going research at Happisburgh, where recently-discovered hominin footprints are the oldest examples outside Africa. The project also involves new work at Barnham, Suffolk. This research is building on previous work at the site by the research team (1989-1994) to investigate a number of key questions about the relationship between different artefact assemblages and the environmental signal at the site. I am also a member of a consortium led by British Museum on an English Heritage funded project which is seeking to establish the extent on-shore and off-shore of the archaeologically important deposits at Happisburgh. My role concerns the onshore geological investigations, results of which will be integrated with onshore and offshore geophysical surveys. I am also a co-investigator on the project, which is exploring the route-ways, dispersals and landscape use of different colonising populations over the last 800,000 years (800 ky) using datasets comprising 80,000 artefact records from over 600 sites held at the British Museum and in other collections. Project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. This multi-institution project has examined the record of human presence in Britain from the oldest Lower Palaeolithic evidence at Happisburgh through to the end of the last ice age and the close of the Upper Palaeolithic. This project has made a significant contribution to understanding the nature and timing of human occupation of Britain and the environmental constraints on human presence. My involvement has mainly been on the older part of the record, including sites such as Happisburgh, High Lodge and Hoxne, but I was also involved in the excavations at the Neanderthal site at Lynford. , in conjunction with British Museum and Reading University focused on the stratigraphy and Palaeolithic archaeology of the Solent River in southern England.

A major focus of Nigel\u2019s work is the creation of whole bioprocess models and the use of these to gain process insights and understanding. Here he works with Dr. Yuhong Zhou in the creation of graphical user interfaces to visualise better process trade offs. With Dr. Suzanne Farid, Nigel has pioneered studies of decisional tools addressing the interface between bioprocessing and business issues. In line with the theme of whole bioprocess modelling, Nigel has collaborated with colleagues at Newcastle University (Professor Gary Montague, Professor Elaine Martin and Dr. Jarka Glassey) to create new ways of improving the performance of manufacturing processes by combining IMRC tools with agent-based methods. Nigel chairs the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Bioprocess Leadership activity now directed by Prof Gary Lye. Since its inception the EngD programme has attracted over 60 sponsor companies to date and nearly 100 projects have been funded under this mechanism which complements the research within the Department. Funding for the above research has come from the UK EPSRC, the TSB Technology Programme and a range of company collaborators. Nigel has held consultancies with a broad range of international companies and serves on the editorial board of key peer-reviewed journals. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2008 in recognition of his pioneering work on biopharmaceuticals manufacturing. He is a Fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and was awarded the Donal Medal for hsi contributions to Biochemical Engineering in 2013. He is Chair of the Board of the prestigious ACS-supported Recovery of Biological Products conference series. Nigel\u2019s current teaching portfolio extends across all of the department\u2019s programmes and include a major emphasis on Integrated Downstream Processing, Fluid Flow Fundamentals and Materials of Construction.

Cellular stress can arise due to various reasons, such as the perturbation\/loss of intra- or extracellular homeostasis, the production of toxic metabolites, damages of intracellular macromolecules, etc. Mechanisms exist in cells that are able to sense and to respond to the presence of cellular stress. Such mechanisms are crucial to the health and development of a multi-cellular organism. Our group is particularly interested in oxidative stress response mechanisms in cells. Oxidative stress is due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Firstly, we would like to understand how ROS might function as signaling molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We demonstrated previously that treatment of cells with a synthetic retinoid known as fenretinide resulted in the expression of the growth-arrest and DNA-damage inducible (Gadd153) gene. Further study of this effect of fenretinide revealed that this retinoid led to the stabilization of the Gadd153 mRNA, most probably through an ROS-dependent mechanism. We are currently investigating the molecular components that are involved in the ROS-mediated regulation of mRNA-stability. Secondly, we are also interested in the metabolism of ROS with a view to understanding how cells might be protected from ROS-induced cellular stress and how ROS might function as an intracellular messenger. The thioredoxin reductase and its substrate thioredoxin are both involved in the redox metabolism of ROS, utilizing electrons donated by NADPH. Under normal circumstances, this system contributes to the overall capacity of a cell to scavenge ROS. Initially known for its role in ROS metabolism, increasing evidence suggests that thioredoxin reductase\/thioredoxin system is involved in the growth and development of normal and abnormal cells. Our studies in the thioredoxin reductase\/thioredoxin system include the investigation of the regulation of intracellular thioredoxin reductase activity at the transcription and post-translational level. Ongoing projects are aimed to elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate the transcription of the thioredoxin reductase gene and the stability of the enzyme protein. Another topic that is of interest to us is apoptosis: a response option that may be selected by cells in the event of stress. Previously, we obtained evidence that the ?-opioid receptor agonist (U50488H) was a potentiating agent for apoptosis through a pathway that apparently involved the Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate\/Ca 2+-signaling pathway. We are currently investigating how such a pathway may act as a signaling pathway for apoptotic cell death. , Maria P. Wong, Zhengyuan Xia, George S. W. Tsao, Michael Q.

The unifying theme in the Sibener Group is to expand understanding of interfacial phenomena at the molecular level that spans fundamental knowledge discovery to applications such as energy systems. Specific areas of interest include: Surface reaction dynamics; gas-surface interaction potentials; phonon structure of surfaces and thin films; gas-surface collisional energy transfer; surface metallurgy and metallic oxidation; self-organization of molecular and polymer thin films including chiral systems; surface dynamics of polymers; superconducting radio frequency (SRF) materials for advanced accelerators; national security with focus on trace gas detection and chemical defense; water purification; ice chemistry in terrestrial and astrophysical environments; hierarchical assembly of functional nanomaterials for energy applications; and electronic and vibronic structure of nanoscale electronic interfaces. Examination of collective behavior in nanoparticle assembled materials studied at the single nanoparticle limit at cryogenic temperatures with scanning tunneling and conductive AFM spectroscopy is a recent addition to the program. Increasingly, studies in the group combine expertise in molecular beam scattering with scanning tunneling\/atomic force microscopy visualization of dynamically evolving interfaces. Multiply-modulated molecular beam scattering techniques are used for the elucidation of heterogeneous reaction mechanisms and dynamics These experiments examine the potential energy surfaces that govern the dynamics of volatile reaction products as a function of adsorbate density, including how interadsorbate effects influence potential energy surfaces. Kinetically-activated reagents are employed to enhance the reaction rate and selectivity of heterogeneous reactions, such as for the Synthesis Gas reaction on rhodium. Another example is how synergistic effects involving UV light and atomic oxygen influence the reactivity of photoactive polymer surfaces, important for delineating how materials react in low-Earth-orbit environments. The group\u2019s newest efforts focus on geometry- and stereo-selected reaction dynamics. Single phonon inelastic He scattering is a surface sensitive method that can be used to map out the full surface phonon structure of clean or molecule-covered interfaces. Recent work has focused on new electronic interfaces, developed at Caltech, that have improved redox properties for electronic and electrochemical applications. Combined experiments and quantum dynamics calculations have shown how molecular vibrations can hybridize with and modify the phonon band structure of methyl-Si(111) interfaces. Studies of gas-surface collisional energy exchange have helped define understanding of the hierarchy of interfacial energy-exchange processes responsible for energy accommodation, sticking, and gaseous condensation. This work is quantitatively addressing how single, few, and multiphonon events contribute to energy exchange under an extraordinarily broad range of dynamical conditions. Quantitative comparisons and beautiful agreement with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations have led to improved understanding of energy and momentum exchange at complex molecular interfaces that are of importance not only for fundamental understanding, but for the refinement of advanced aircraft and spacecraft flight surfaces. Another ongoing effort is in the area of surface metallurgy and metallic oxidation, where molecular beam and time-lapse STM studies have elucidated definitive oxidation mechanisms for atomic, energetic, and electron-assisted processes. The group is currently examining the oxidation and nitridation of Nb to improve understanding of how surface-to-bulk oxygen and nitrogen transport occurs, and how it can influence the performance of superconducting RF cavities used in particle accelerators. The dynamical properties and organization of molecular and polymeric thin films is another current focus of the group. Atomic force microscopy is being used to examine the pathways by which defects evolve and annihilate during the annealing of polymers. Recent work has led to the development of new methods, now widely adopted, for guiding the spatial organization of diblock copolymers in nano-confinement while achieving near structural perfection. Experiments being done at elevated temperatures above the glass transition where real-time\/real-space dynamics for domain organization, grain boundary mobility, and defect elimination can be followed, revealing precise details of the mechanism and kinetics for polymer organization in thin films. In separate work on molecular systems, our current focus is on understanding and controlling the chirality of adsorbed films. The Sibener Group has pioneered the use of low energy, nondestructive neutral atom inelastic scattering to probe the surface vibrational characteristics of polymer surfaces. This has proven to be a most incisive approach, revealing how polymer dynamics change due to nano-confinement as film thickness approaches the radii of gyration of the polymer chains. Helium scattering has also been used to assess how surface vibrational dynamics change when going from the amorphous to the complex crystalline phase of PET. The group has several ongoing projects that focus on the chemistry of ice, especially the trapping and release of adsorbed and embedded trace gases for purposes of environmental, astrophysical, and national defense science. Recently, work in this area has demonstrated that high-energy gas-surface collisions can embed species into ice once energetic barriers have been exceeded. These latter experiments are significant for many fields, including trace gas collection and detection, climate change, and astrophysical chemistry involving planetary systems, interstellar dust, and comets. We are one of the lead groups at UChicago that is participating in the Institute for Molecular Engineering\u2019s new Water Research Initiative. This new effort has components that are associated with the catalytic destruction and filtering of contaminants. A powerful route for the creation of functional nanomaterials is hierarchical self-assembly. Here one can use top-down\/bottom-up methods to organize complex structures that would be prohibitively time consuming to fabricate using traditional lithography-only paradigms. The group has been using such methods for the synthesis of functional photovoltaic thin film devices, ultra-high density magnetic systems involving magnetic nanoparticles, and highly efficacious surface enhanced Raman (SERS) substrates.

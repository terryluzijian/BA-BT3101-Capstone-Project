Updates on NUS migration will be published here, where available. <SEPARATOR> Only suppliers who have registered with SESAMi will be able to download invitation documents and respond to our procurement opportunities. Interested suppliers please visit <SEPARATOR> https://sesami.online/SupplierRegistration/IntroductionNUS.aspx <SEPARATOR> to register for an account. The first user account is free, if your company requires additional user accounts, it will be chargeable. This is similar to GeBIZ. Existing SESAMi account holders who are registered with another company will still be required to register for an account under NUS. <SEPARATOR> Please email <SEPARATOR> contactcpo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> or call Miss Chew Shu Jen at 6601 5767 if you need clarifications on the GeBIZ migration. For enquiries on registration with SESAMi, please email <SEPARATOR> customercare@sesami.com <SEPARATOR> or call 63331188 (Helpline option 2). <SEPARATOR> Frequently Asked Questions <SEPARATOR> Q1: Why are NUS\u2019 procurements no longer published or carried out in GeBIZ? <SEPARATOR> A1: NUS is an autonomous university and corporatised entity. It is more efficient and effective for such entities to procure on their own platforms in that they can tailor-make their platforms to suit their procurement needs. <SEPARATOR> Q2: Will NUS procurement be governed by the Government procurement regime? <SEPARATOR> A2: NUS is an autonomous university, incorporated in Singapore as a public company limited by guarantee, and is governed by the National University of Singapore (Corporatisation) Act. NUS formulates and maintains its own procurement policy which is separate from the government procurement policy framework applicable to government agencies such as ministries and statutory boards. However, NUS is still covered under Government Procurement Regulations. <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> NUS Procurement <SEPARATOR> 21 Lower Kent Ridge Road <SEPARATOR> Singapore 119077 <SEPARATOR>  <SEPARATOR>  <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> .

If you want to go far, go together.\u201d According to Ms Martha Choe, former Chief Adminstration Officer of The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), this African proverb has helped shape the Foundation\u2019s mission to deliver \u201ccatalytic philanthropy\u201d, or philanthropy that serves as a game changer by removing the cause of suffering. <SEPARATOR> Ms Choe was speaking at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Greater Good Series event titled: \u201cWhat I learned at the Gates Foundation\u201d. The event was chaired by Ms Euleen Goh, Rector of the University Scholars Programme Residential College at NUS University Town. <SEPARATOR> Ms Choe shared her key learnings from her time at BMGF, from the philanthropic, organisational and personal perspectives. She shared that the Foundation set out to identify the greatest areas of need as well as those where they could make the greatest impact. As such, they chose to focus on four key areas: Global Health, Global Development, Global Policy and Advocacy; and a United States Programme. <SEPARATOR> The Foundation understands that it must differentiate itself from being a charity and deliver catalytic philanthropy. For example, no sum will ever be considered sufficient enough to treat HIV AIDS. However, if you invest in Research and Development and discover a vaccine, you can change lives forever and reduce the amount of money required for treatment. <SEPARATOR> The Foundation also recognises the importance of partnerships in delivering their goals. This can be in the form of influencing government policy \u2013 for example, convincing governments to maintain their Overseas Development Aid contributions during times of financial crisis as this aid has a huge impact on the reduction of poverty \u2013 or through partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry \u2013 such as putting in place Intellectual Property (IP) agreements that allow the company to maintain the IP for a vaccine on the condition they give it away for free or at a minimal cost. It is also critical to work closely with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) as they know the local communities and universities as they are hotbeds for research and development. Obtaining feedback from grantees is also critical. <SEPARATOR> Being a risk taker and a risk funder are also fundamental to success. Ms Choe shared that Bill Gates claims he will be happy if 10 percent of the projects he backs deliver the potential they promised and prove to be game changers. The Foundation also understands the value of data in determining decision making and measuring success. <SEPARATOR> From a personal viewpoint, Ms Choe shared that the time she spent at the BMCF taught her the necessary skills to work within the \u201cwhite space\u201d of a start-up organisation which is constantly evolving. She also learnt the value of driving growth and change by empowering people who are smarter than her. <SEPARATOR> She concluded her talk by saying that now, as she is at the stage of her career where she is being \u201crewired\u201d, she is learning from those around her and contemplating the future. She shared that she was honoured to be talking to a room of people who have played an important role in shaping Singapore over the last 50 years and she looks forward to following the country\u2019s success over the next half a century. <SEPARATOR> The NUS Greater Good Series features talks by leading minds on topics related to philanthropy. These include generosity, giving and service to the community, as well as leadership, personal well-being and mental resilience.

Also present were NUS President Prof TAN Chorh Chuan and Deputy President and Provost Prof TAN Eng Chye. <SEPARATOR> President Tony Tan had the opportunity to meet a group of 11 Science students, and briefly chatted with them. The students were thrilled at meeting the President. <SEPARATOR> During the dinner, Dean of Faculty of Science, Prof SHEN Zuowei spoke of the rapid technological changes and scientific challenges of the 4 <SEPARATOR> Industrial Revolution which made the learning of science even more important. To take Singapore to the next level of advancement, it is now even more imperative to invest in science education to grow a critical mass of science-educated graduates. <SEPARATOR> Prof Shen said, \u201cScience graduates are particularly valuable in times of uncertainty and disruption. While technology can turn obsolete in the blink of an eye, the fundamental knowledge of science and attributes such as critical thinking, problem-solving and passion for discovery have enduring value.\u201d <SEPARATOR> Prof Shen is the Co-Chair of the Science Scholarship initiative, together with Prof Leo TAN, Director of Special Projects at the Faculty. Prof Leo Tan also took to the stage with a rallying call to guests to support the building of an endowment fund that will provide scholarships to attract talented students with the aptitude and ability to study Science at NUS. <SEPARATOR> Prof Tan also emphasised that a donation was an investment in nurturing a young life. Going on to explain that students receive academic mentoring as well as emotional and mental or spiritual support, he said, \u201cUniversity life is but a sojourn and we prepare our graduates not just with professional or domain competence but also to aspire to live their lives meaningfully.\u201d Prof Tan also thanked the benefactors who had already contributed to the establishing of scholarships to kickstart the initiative. <SEPARATOR> Two students also shared on how NUS\u2019 Transformative Science Education helped them to ignite their passion, hone their skills and fulfil their dreams. <SEPARATOR> First to speak was Benjamin GOH, Year 4 Physics, and a Global Merit scholar. He shared on how he discovered his interest in communicating and explaining science to others and his experience working in sales and marketing for a social start-up which specialises in using animation as a pedagogical tool for public education in various topics such as Diabetes Disease Management, Biotechnology, Psychology and even Physics. He expressed his gratitude to NUS for the scholarship that gave him the freedom and security to pursue his interest. <SEPARATOR> Samantha LAI, who was awarded the NUS Faculty Scholarship as an undergraduate, then spoke on how the scholarship fuelled her passion in conservation during her studies at the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS). The scholarship had enabled her to truly develop herself by opening doors to diverse and enriching learning opportunities. These opportunities, including a Student Exchange Programme to Sweden and an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme in Science (UROPS) project on reef corals, nurtured her deep interest in marine ecology and conservation. She is currently pursuing a Ph.D. after working for a few years at the National Parks Board. <SEPARATOR> Guests also enjoyed a performance by the BioEnsemble, a group of students and staff from DBS who regaled the crowd with two upbeat songs. Their performance was met with rousing applause from the audience. <SEPARATOR> Of particular note was the presence of retired Professor Dennis H. MURPHY and many ex-students and friends who gathered to honour him with the establishment of a scholarship in his name. <SEPARATOR> The memorable occasion was marked by laughter and merriment as staff and students mingled with guests throughout the night. <SEPARATOR> This article was first published on the <SEPARATOR> NUS Faculty of Science website <SEPARATOR> If you would like to make a gift towards the Science Merit Scholarship please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> .

More importantly, travelling as a university student on an exchange programme makes an invaluable difference to one\u2019s education. <SEPARATOR> And because he believes so deeply in the value of a cross-cultural experience, the former President of the NUS Business School Alumni Association (NUSBSAA) not only started the NUSBSAA Student Experience Fund, he also made a generous gift to the Fund to ensure that more students can expand their horizons. <SEPARATOR> \u201cIt is important for our Singaporean students to see our little red dot in the global context \u2013 being a small country with all the challenges this engenders. It is crucial for them to realise, even at a young age, how the world is truly our oyster with which we must do business to survive! Getting that precious chance to see the world, when studying at the University, can open eyes that no traditional classroom teachings can,\u201d he expresses. <SEPARATOR> The NUSBSAA Student Experience Fund was set up in 2011 to allow undergraduate students facing financial difficulty to go on exchange programmes with prestigious partner universities and help them defray overseas expenses such as costs of accommodation and daily necessities. <SEPARATOR> Having gone on two international programmes during his undergraduate days at the NUS Business School, Mr Lee is convinced time spent abroad can broaden young minds. He had the rare privilege to be exposed to the unique Japanese culture when he was one of two students from the NUS Business School to be awarded a Japan Airlines Scholarship to spend a semester at Sophia University in Tokyo. <SEPARATOR> \u201cWe were stumped by how advanced Japan was at that time compared to Singapore. And seeing how polite and civil they were with one another, whether at home or in the subway, was also eye-opening for many of us from Southeast Asia. It really made us sit up and take notice and, of course being the good students we all were, debate on how we could change Singapore to achieve such a high level of social cohesion,\u201d he reflects. <SEPARATOR> Doing a market research project at Caterpillar Far East in Hong Kong while on the Aiesec International programme led Mr Lee to his present career in international marketing, something he is still engaged in after 37 years. <SEPARATOR> \u201cThe two experiences made a deep impact on me and I felt that students who qualify for exchange programmes should not be deprived of doing so despite being financially challenged,\u201d he says. <SEPARATOR> The businessman attributes his successful career in international marketing (he has since set up his own business in advising and managing the distribution networks of major American manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region) to \u201cthe seeds of interest planted during his NUS undergraduate days\u201d and hopes that more alumni will give back to their alma mater. <SEPARATOR> \u201cI am truly blessed by the opportunities I had at NUS and I hope students will treasure the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities presented to them,\u201d he adds. <SEPARATOR> For information on making a gift to NUS, contact us at 1800-DEVELOP (1800-338-3567) or email <SEPARATOR> askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> If you have a story to share, please contact us at <SEPARATOR> whatsyourstory@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Development Office <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Shaw Foundation Alumni House #03-01 <SEPARATOR> 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244 <SEPARATOR> Tel: +65 6516 8000 <SEPARATOR> Fax: +65 6775 9161 <SEPARATOR> Email: askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Website: www.giving.nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Why Give <SEPARATOR> Benefits of Giving <SEPARATOR> History of Giving in NUS <SEPARATOR> Where to Give <SEPARATOR> Giving to Students <SEPARATOR> Giving to Academics <SEPARATOR> Giving to Research <SEPARATOR> Giving to Campus Infrastructure <SEPARATOR> Giving to a School <SEPARATOR> How to Give <SEPARATOR> Methods of Giving <SEPARATOR> Alumni Giving <SEPARATOR> Leadership Giving <SEPARATOR> Commencement Class Giving <SEPARATOR> Faculty and Staff Giving <SEPARATOR> Be a Volunteer <SEPARATOR> News and Events <SEPARATOR> Giving News <SEPARATOR> Events <SEPARATOR> Photo Gallery <SEPARATOR> Video Gallery <SEPARATOR> Publications <SEPARATOR> Champions <SEPARATOR> Our Champions, Our Ambassadors <SEPARATOR> About Us <SEPARATOR> Mission Statement <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Contact Us <SEPARATOR> Standard Terms and Conditions for Gifts <SEPARATOR> IPC Disclosure Information <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Development Office <SEPARATOR> Shaw Foundation Alumni House <SEPARATOR> #03-01 <SEPARATOR> 11 Kent Ridge Drive <SEPARATOR> Singapore 119244 <SEPARATOR> +65 6516 8000 <SEPARATOR> askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR>  <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> .

Interested suppliers please visit <SEPARATOR> https://sesami.online/SupplierRegistration/IntroductionNUS.aspx <SEPARATOR> to register for an account.

It is more efficient and effective for such entities to procure on their own platforms in that they can tailor-make their platforms to suit their procurement needs. <SEPARATOR> Q2: Will NUS procurement be governed by the Government procurement regime? <SEPARATOR> A2: NUS is an autonomous university, incorporated in Singapore as a public company limited by guarantee, and is governed by the National University of Singapore (Corporatisation) Act. NUS formulates and maintains its own procurement policy which is separate from the government procurement policy framework applicable to government agencies such as ministries and statutory boards.

Now a First Year Law student at the National University of Singapore\u2019s (NUS) Faculty of Law, she is on to her third scholarship \u2013 the Lee Kong Chian-NUS Global Merit scholarship. Tok Kheng Leng, a First Year student at NUS\u2019 Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, was mentioned at last year\u2019s National Day Rally for being a young citizen with a big heart. She, too is an NUS Global Merit Scholarship recipient. <SEPARATOR> Yee Ting and Kheng Leng are just two of 10 outstanding NUS students who are receiving the NUS Global Merit Scholarship this year. The Scholarship rewards outstanding Singaporean students who demonstrate academic excellence, strong leadership qualities and creative and innovative thinking. <SEPARATOR> In the coming years, NUS wishes to award this prestigious scholarship to up to the top five percent of its Singaporean students with support from the philanthropic community. To encourage gifts to the NUS Global Merit Scholarship, the University will be supplementing gifts to these scholarships as an expression of its commitment to this cause. This top-up will be in addition to the 1:1.5 matching that gifts to NUS receive from the government. <SEPARATOR> Students like Yee Ting and Kheng Leng embody tomorrow\u2019s promise. To challenge and maximise the potential of these exceptional students, the NUS Global Merit Scholarship brings with it a plethora of opportunities \u2013 from overseas enrichment programmes, conferences and seminars to workshops and more. <SEPARATOR> Kheng Leng, a keen social worker, pioneered a community project, \u201cBalik Kampung\u201d, which aims to re-ignite the compassionate Kampung spirit in today\u2019s Singapore. Now enrolled in the University Scholars Programme, a multi-disciplinary academic programme offered to NUS undergraduates, she says, \u201cI am really psyched about applying for the NUS Overseas College in Shanghai or Semester at Sea.\u201d Semester at Sea is a multiple country study abroad programme that offers hands-on field experiences and meaningful engagement in the global community. <SEPARATOR> Yee Ting, who won two Ministry of Education scholarships at school, is a member of the Law Student International Relations Club. She is community-conscious and a dancer. Yee Ting says, \u201cI did consider studying abroad but I chose to study in NUS because NUS\u2019 Faculty of Law is one of the top rated Law programmes in the world. Moreover, I am planning to practise law in Singapore in the future, so there is no better place than NUS.\u201d <SEPARATOR> Intelligence, passion and vigour are part of these students\u2019 DNA. By offering Singapore\u2019s best and brightest access to a world of opportunities, NUS is grooming a new generation of global leaders and change-makers. <SEPARATOR> For more information about NUS Global Merit Scholarships, visit <SEPARATOR> http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/scholarships/freshmen/scp/scholarship-scp-nus-global-merit.html <SEPARATOR> For information on making a gift to NUS, contact us at 1800-DEVELOP (1800-338-3567) or email <SEPARATOR> askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> If you have a story to share, please contact us at <SEPARATOR> whatsyourstory@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Development Office <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Shaw Foundation Alumni House #03-01 <SEPARATOR> 11 Kent Ridge Drive, Singapore 119244 <SEPARATOR> Tel: +65 6516 8000 <SEPARATOR> Fax: +65 6775 9161 <SEPARATOR> Email: askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Website: www.giving.nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Why Give <SEPARATOR> Benefits of Giving <SEPARATOR> History of Giving in NUS <SEPARATOR> Where to Give <SEPARATOR> Giving to Students <SEPARATOR> Giving to Academics <SEPARATOR> Giving to Research <SEPARATOR> Giving to Campus Infrastructure <SEPARATOR> Giving to a School <SEPARATOR> How to Give <SEPARATOR> Methods of Giving <SEPARATOR> Alumni Giving <SEPARATOR> Leadership Giving <SEPARATOR> Commencement Class Giving <SEPARATOR> Faculty and Staff Giving <SEPARATOR> Be a Volunteer <SEPARATOR> News and Events <SEPARATOR> Giving News <SEPARATOR> Events <SEPARATOR> Photo Gallery <SEPARATOR> Video Gallery <SEPARATOR> Publications <SEPARATOR> Champions <SEPARATOR> Our Champions, Our Ambassadors <SEPARATOR> About Us <SEPARATOR> Mission Statement <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Contact Us <SEPARATOR> Standard Terms and Conditions for Gifts <SEPARATOR> IPC Disclosure Information <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Development Office <SEPARATOR> Shaw Foundation Alumni House <SEPARATOR> #03-01 <SEPARATOR> 11 Kent Ridge Drive <SEPARATOR> Singapore 119244 <SEPARATOR> +65 6516 8000 <SEPARATOR> askdvo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR>  <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> .

More information on the portfolio, FSA and SJT is available <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> Discretionary Admissions <SEPARATOR> Exceptional Individual Scheme (For discretionary admissions) <SEPARATOR> The Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine offers admission to a small number of talented and qualified individuals (for up to 10% of the intake) through a route known as the Exceptional Individual Scheme (EIS). <SEPARATOR> The EIS was developed as a way of exercising discretionary criteria in admitting a small number of students to the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Applications submitted through this route will be evaluated by the Selection Committee on the basis of exceptional talent and achievement, in addition to academic results. <SEPARATOR> Students who wish to be considered under the EIS have to submit a portfolio consisting of the following: <SEPARATOR> A personal statement (500 words)* <SEPARATOR> List of co-curricular activities <SEPARATOR> Official testimonial from your junior college or high school <SEPARATOR> Two referee reports (Instructions and login details will be provided to nominated referees to fill up an online questionnaire consisting of 6-8 questions.) <SEPARATOR> *This is a separate statement from the 2000 characters essay found in the NUS OAM application. <SEPARATOR> Your application for admission will first be considered under the standard admissions pathway by the NUS Office of Admissions. If your University Admissions Score meets the cut-off point for Medicine, you will be shortlisted and invited for interviews and you will not be considered an EIS candidate. <SEPARATOR> If you do not meet the cut-off point set by the NUS Office of Admissions, your application will be considered under the EIS. You will not need to compile a portfolio, as your EIS application will serve as your dossier (if you are shortlisted for the interviews). <SEPARATOR> If you were previously shortlisted and attended an NUS Medicine interview but were not offered a place and wish to re-apply, you must also submit an EIS application in addition to the online application submitted through the NUS Office of Admissions. You will not be granted an interview if you fail to comply with this requirement. This is because under the normal admissions criteria, a candidate is not granted repeat interviews for Medicine. <SEPARATOR> Shortlisted applicants will be invited to attend the Focused Skills Assessment and Situational Judgement Test together with candidates shortlisted via the standard route. Before applying under EIS, interested applicants must have also submitted an online application through the NUS Office of Admissions by the application deadline. <SEPARATOR> EIS applications for AY 2017/18 has closed. Please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> for more information. <SEPARATOR> Lodging an Appeal <SEPARATOR> Lodging an Appeal <SEPARATOR> The online appeal exercise took place from May to June 2017. <SEPARATOR> Given the very competitive demand for the limited number of places available in the NUS Medicine undergraduate degree programme, all applications for admission are reviewed thoroughly and extensively. Candidates lodging appeals should therefore note the highly unlikely eventuality of success. <SEPARATOR> The exercise has closed and outcomes have been made known in end June / early July 2017. For more information, please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> MBBS Admission FAQ <SEPARATOR> 1. How does the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine conduct its admissions process? <SEPARATOR> In selecting students who will be trained and educated to become the next generation of doctors for Singapore, it is necessary to look beyond academic measures. Some other attributes of a good doctor are pro-social behaviour, strong communication skills, insight, integrity, teamwork, meticulous work habits and a sense of responsibility. Our careful examination of this issue has involved discussion with many segments of the medical community and research into best practices from top medical schools around the world. Admission to NUS Medicine is extremely competitive. Each year, we make difficult decisions when selecting from among the many talented and accomplished students who apply for admission. <SEPARATOR> 2. How is admission to the Medicine undergraduate degree programme conducted? <SEPARATOR> Applicants will be shortlisted for the Focused Skills Assessment (FSA) and Situational Judgement Test (SJT) based on their A-level, diploma or high school results. Admission to NUS Medicine is based on the candidate's performance in the FSA and SJT. <SEPARATOR> 3. What subject prerequisites must I have? <SEPARATOR> The subject prerequisites are as follows: <SEPARATOR> 'A' Level Prerequisites: <SEPARATOR> A good H2 pass in Chemistry and a good H2 pass in either Biology or Physics of the best four content subjects (i.e. three H2 and one H1 content subjects) used in the computation of the University Admission Score, at least one content subject (either H2 or H1) must be from a contrasting discipline <SEPARATOR> International Baccalaureate Prerequisites: <SEPARATOR> A good pass in HL Chemistry and either HL Biology or Physics <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore High School Diploma Prerequisites: <SEPARATOR> Major CAP of at least 2.0 in Chemistry and either Biology or Physics, and CAP of at least 1.0 in one other major and in English Programme and Research Project <SEPARATOR> Polytechnic: <SEPARATOR> An approved diploma from a polytechnic in Singapore. Please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> to see the list of acceptable diplomas for admission to Medicine. <SEPARATOR> Other qualification prerequisites: <SEPARATOR> A good pass in Chemistry and either Biology or Physics in high school <SEPARATOR> 4. Given my academic results, what are my chances of being shortlisted for Medicine? <SEPARATOR> The cut-off point depends on the competition of the pool of applicants each year. You may review last year's <SEPARATOR> indicative grade profile <SEPARATOR> for NUS Medicine. <SEPARATOR> 5. What is the Focused Skills Assessment (FSA)? <SEPARATOR> This is a series of stations, each examining a specific characteristic of the candidate. The station can be a mini-interview or performance of a focused task. Each station is standardised. <SEPARATOR> Examiners at each station are faculty members, doctors, allied health professionals, and medical alumni. All examiners are carefully selected and trained before the selection exercise. The assessment will be conducted over 60 minutes. <SEPARATOR> 6. What is a Situational Judgement Test (SJT)? <SEPARATOR> The SJT is a 60 minute pen-and-paper MCQ test designed to assess judgement in medicine-relevant situations. All students who have been shortlisted for NUS Medicine must sit for the SJT. <SEPARATOR> 7. What if I am unable to make it for either or both the Focused Skills Assessment (FSA) and the Situational Judgement Test (SJT)? <SEPARATOR> Candidates must sit for the FSA and SJT in order to be considered for Medicine. If you have a legitimate, conflicting appointment or are ill, contact the Dean\u2019s Office immediately. Male candidates currently serving National Service will be released by MINDEF to sit for the FSA and SJT. <SEPARATOR> Contact details will be provided on the shortlist letter/email sent to you. <SEPARATOR> 8. Is there any special format for the personal statement, resume, extracurricular activities and referee reports? <SEPARATOR> Personal statement \u2013 Limited to 500 words (This is separate from the 2000 characters essay found in the NUS OAM application) <SEPARATOR> Extracurricular activities \u2013 A form to be filled up via the online portal <SEPARATOR> Two referee reports \u2013 An online questionnaire consisting of 6-8 questions will be filled by nominated referees of shortlisted candidates <SEPARATOR> 9. Will my portfolio be returned to me after the admissions process? <SEPARATOR> 10. Who can write the referee reports? <SEPARATOR> The referee report must be written by a person who is not related to you but knows you well. Please <SEPARATOR> do not <SEPARATOR> nominate family members, relatives and friends as your referee. The person who wrote your school testimonial can be nominated as your referee. For NS men, a letter written by your Commanding Officer or any other relevant SAF/Police/SCDF officer is acceptable. <SEPARATOR> 11. What should I write about in my personal statement? <SEPARATOR> We are interested in the experiences that have shaped your desire to study medicine here at NUS. Please focus on telling your particular story. You can think of your personal statement as a letter of introduction to your interviewers, as they will read it before meeting you in person. <SEPARATOR> 12. Can my referees mail their letters directly to the Dean\u2019s Office? <SEPARATOR> No. If you are shortlisted, your nominated referees will need to submit their reports via the link provided to them. <SEPARATOR> 13. What is the Exceptional Individual Scheme (EIS)? <SEPARATOR> The EIS was developed as a way of exercising discretionary criteria in admitting a small number of students to the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Applications submitted through this route will be evaluated by the Selection Committee on the basis of exceptional talent and achievement in addition to academic results. <SEPARATOR> Please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> for more information. <SEPARATOR> 14. I came for the interview last year but was not offered a place in Medicine. Can I re-apply? <SEPARATOR> Yes, you may re-apply. Under normal admission criteria, a candidate is not granted repeat interviews for Medicine. However, in addition to your online application through the NUS Office of Admissions, you should lodge an application to the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine under the <SEPARATOR> Exceptional Individual Scheme (EIS) <SEPARATOR> in order to be considered for an interview. Your application will then be considered with other applicants for the current year of admission. <SEPARATOR> If you were enrolled in NUS/NTU/SMU previously, you can consider applying under Category E, when the application opens in February. Your application will be considered on the basis of your university results in addition to your 'A' level/high school results. If you are enrolled in a local university, please note that your eligibility for the MOE Tuition Grant is equal to the number of years in your new course, minus the number of years you have already spent in a local university. Thus, if you enrol in Medicine after one year at NUS/NTU/SMU, you would be liable for full (non-subsidised) tuition fees for your last year in Medicine. This is a new policy, effective in 2008-09. For more information on fees and the MOE Tuition Grant, click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> If you are performing National Service, we recommend that you re-apply next year under the appropriate qualification category. <SEPARATOR> 15. Can I appeal if I am not offered a place after attending the interviews? <SEPARATOR> Every year, nearly 2,000 students apply to study Medicine at NUS. About 900 are shortlisted for interviews to fill 300 places. We regret that we must turn away many deserving candidates. Please understand that your candidacy would have been carefully considered, and the decisions of the Admissions Committee are final. If you decide to appeal, you should remain realistic about your chances. At this time, all places have been filled. Should any student withdraw from the class before the beginning of term, we may be able to make an offer to shortlisted students on our reserve list. In the meantime, if you were offered another course of study at NUS or at another university, or are in receipt of a scholarship offer, we would encourage you to take up that opportunity. <SEPARATOR> 16. I am not offered a place in the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine but would like to study medicine in Singapore. What other options do I have? <SEPARATOR> You may wish to consider the <SEPARATOR> Duke-NUS Medical School <SEPARATOR> , a partnership between NUS and Duke University School of Medicine in the U.S. This four-year programme, culminating in the degree of Medical Doctor (M.D.), accepts students with bachelor's degrees and will enable graduates to practice medicine in Singapore. <SEPARATOR> Alternatively, you may consider applying to the <SEPARATOR> Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine <SEPARATOR> (LKCSoM), NTU. The admissions processes of NUS Medicine and LKCSoM are independent of each other. An applicant who has applied for admission to the Medicine course at NUS is not disadvantaged when applying for admission to LKCSoM. <SEPARATOR> 17. Can I study medicine overseas for a few years and then transfer to NUS? <SEPARATOR> Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs) attending medical school overseas may apply to transfer to NUS. In the event that a vacancy is available in that particular year (which is not always the case), candidates will be considered based on their 'A' level/high school results and their medical school results. Please note that NUS has a residency requirement of 50%, so transfer students must spend at least three years in the medical school at NUS, no matter how many years they have already completed elsewhere. For more information, please click <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> 18. Can I study medicine overseas and return to Singapore for my house officer or residency training? <SEPARATOR> International medical graduates from any of the medical schools listed on the Singapore Medical Council's (SMC) Schedule of schools will be eligible to apply for medical registration with SMC to undertake housemanship or residency in Singapore upon their return. If you are keen on returning to practise medicine in Singapore upon graduating from a medical school overseas, you are strongly encouraged to enrol in and complete your medical training at one of the schools on the SMC's Schedule. Otherwise, you are advised to attain a postgraduate medical qualification recognised by SMC in order to be considered for medical registration. It will also be beneficial for you to familiarise yourself with the requirements and criteria for medical registration in Singapore. More information regarding the SMC's list of basic and postgraduate medical qualifications as well as criteria for medical registration can be found on its website at <SEPARATOR> www.smc.gov.sg <SEPARATOR> 19. Bonds for Medical students? <SEPARATOR> Candidates admitted to the Medicine course at the National University of Singapore, who are not in receipt of PSC scholarships, are required to serve the Government of Singapore upon successful completion of the course according to the scheme in the following table: <SEPARATOR> Course <SEPARATOR> Singaporeans <SEPARATOR> Singapore PRs and International Students <SEPARATOR> Medicine <SEPARATOR> 5 years <SEPARATOR> (excluding housemanship / first year residency training) <SEPARATOR> 6 years <SEPARATOR> (excluding housemanship / first year residency training) <SEPARATOR> PSC scholarship recipients who are concurrently awarded the President's Scholarship to read Medicine will be required to sign an agreement with the Government and be bonded according to the terms of the scholarship.

Are all medical students in an overseas institution eligible to apply for transfer to the School of Medicine? <SEPARATOR> Only Singapore Citizens and its Permanent Residents who are current medical students of recognised overseas institutions are eligible. These overseas institutions must be recognised by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC). The list of schools can be found <SEPARATOR> here <SEPARATOR> . Foreign students must apply via the standard admissions route to begin at Year 1. <SEPARATOR> 2. Are all transfer students accepted into the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine? <SEPARATOR> Transfers to NUS Medicine are handled on an individual, case-by-case basis, in the event that a vacancy is available in that particular year. <SEPARATOR> 3. How does NUS Medicine consider transfer applicants? <SEPARATOR> Applicants are considered on the merits of their 'A' level or high school results, and their university results. Once shortlisted, an interview will be conducted via teleconference, unless the transfer applicant is in Singapore. <SEPARATOR> 4. Given my academic results, what are my chances of being shortlisted for the interview? <SEPARATOR> The competition will depend on the number of places available, and the number of students who apply for that particular year. <SEPARATOR> 5. Does a transfer student need to repeat the years which he/she has already completed in the overseas medical school? <SEPARATOR> Transfer students will be informed of the year of study where the vacancy is available. The student may not need to repeat years already completed, if there is an appropriate availability and the curriculum of the medical undergraduate programme at his/her home university aligns with that of NUS Medicine. If a transfer student is admitted, we will work to ensure a smooth transition and address any gaps in the medical curriculum and training. <SEPARATOR> 6. How does the NUS residency requirement affect the transfer applications? <SEPARATOR> NUS has established a minimum of 50% residency requirement for all NUS degrees. This means that a transfer student would need to complete three full years at NUS, regardless of the number of years he/she may have already completed in a medical school overseas. <SEPARATOR> 7. I attended an interview for Medicine admissions previously. Am I eligible for a transfer? <SEPARATOR> Yes, you are eligible to apply for a transfer. <SEPARATOR> 8. What is the bond period for transfer students? <SEPARATOR> Candidates admitted to the Medicine undergraduate degree course at the National University of Singapore, who are not in receipt of PSC scholarships or bursaries, are required to serve the Government of Singapore upon successful completion of the course according to the scheme in the following table: <SEPARATOR> Course <SEPARATOR> Singaporeans <SEPARATOR> Singapore PRs and International Students <SEPARATOR> Medicine <SEPARATOR> 5 years <SEPARATOR> (excluding housemanship) <SEPARATOR> 6 years <SEPARATOR> (excluding housemanship) <SEPARATOR> Each student is required to sign an agreement with the Government to serve the specified bond period, failing which liquidated damages will be payable. <SEPARATOR> Your acceptance of the offer of admission to the Medicine undergraduate degree programme at NUS is conditional upon your signing the necessary bond with the relevant authority in the year of entry to the University. At the time of signing of the bond, the Ministry of Health, Singapore, will require that you affirm your willingness and ability to serve out the bond upon graduation. You will also need to verify that you have not renounced your Singaporean citizenship or PR status, and that you have no criminal history which may render you ineligible for registration to practise medicine in Singapore. <SEPARATOR> Candidates are allowed to enrol for the Medicine undergraduate degree programme on the understanding that they will fulfil these conditions, unless they fail to obtain the degree of MBBS. Failure to fulfil this condition will result in candidates not being awarded the degrees concerned. They will also be liable to pay liquidated damages. <SEPARATOR> 9. How do I apply for a transfer to the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine? <SEPARATOR> If you are interested in transferring to NUS Medicine, please email your resume, transcript from your medical school and a letter stating the reason(s) for the transfer to <SEPARATOR> This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. <SEPARATOR> . We will contact you when a vacancy is available. <SEPARATOR> Health Requirements <SEPARATOR> Health Requirements <SEPARATOR> Admission to Medicine is subject to the following health requirements. These requirements are subject to changes in accordance with the Singapore Ministry of Health. <SEPARATOR> Health Requirements <SEPARATOR> Details <SEPARATOR> Mumps, Measles and Rubella (MMR) <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students should be immune (from documented infection) or fully vaccinated. Candidates should produce official records of previous vaccinations or serological screening results or physician documented diagnoses of previous infection as proof of immunity. Self-declaration is not sufficient. <SEPARATOR> A student may begin classes without documentary evidence of immunisation for MMR if he/she has a letter from a physician stating that there is a reason why he/she cannot receive the vaccine. <SEPARATOR> Varicella (Chickenpox) <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students must undergo screening for immunity to the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). Candidates with a negative or equivocal titres as defined by the reference range of an accredited testing laboratory will require immunisation. Certification of past infection/previous immunisation of chickenpox is not acceptable as there are issues with clinical diagnosis and the risk of transmission from students to vulnerable patients is significant. <SEPARATOR> A student may begin classes without documentary evidence of immunisation for Chickenpox if: <SEPARATOR> He/she has a letter from a physician stating that there is a reason why he/she cannot receive the vaccine; <SEPARATOR> He/she concerned has documented evidence of two administrations of the varicella vaccine (non-responders). <SEPARATOR> Pertussis <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students should produce documented proof of vaccination with Tdap. Those who have not previously received tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) should be vaccinated with a single dose of Tdap, regardless of the interval since the last dose of tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine. Proof of vaccination with Td alone is insufficient. Self-declaration is not accepted as proof of immunity. <SEPARATOR> Blood-Borne Diseases (BBD) <SEPARATOR> Hepatitis B <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students must be screened for hepatitis B carriage and show documented serological evidence of immunity against hepatitis B (i.e. anti-HBs =10 mIU/mL). Hepatitis B-negative students who do not have documented serological evidence of immunity against hepatitis B (i.e. anti-HBs =10 mIU/mL) must be vaccinated with the primary course series (i.e. 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine). A post-vaccination serology test should be conducted to determine the concentration of protective antibodies, i.e. anti-HBs of at least 10mIU/mL. <SEPARATOR> Hepatitis C <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students must be screened for hepatitis C. <SEPARATOR> All prospective medical students must be screened for HIV. <SEPARATOR> Screening should be carried out before final admission into the course, as results may affect students' career choices. Students tested positive for Hep B, Hep C and/or HIV will be counselled to understand that their areas of practice may be restricted in future to non-exposure-prone procedure areas. <SEPARATOR> Financial Assistance <SEPARATOR> Financial Assistance <SEPARATOR> The National University of Singapore is committed to a needs-blind merit-based admission policy that ensures no deserving student admitted to the University is denied an education because of financial difficulty. In addition to the scholarships offered by the Office of Financial Aid, the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine offers its own scholarships and bursaries to assist students with financial difficulties. Scholarships and bursaries are open for application as part of the <SEPARATOR> NUS Financial Aid application <SEPARATOR> from February to April each year.

The collection, which is on a long-term loan to NUS Museum, also includes depictions of Vietnam\u2019s cross-border conflicts with Cambodia and China (1976 \u2013 1986). The works were collected by Dato\u2019 N. Parameswaran during his appointment as Ambassador of Malaysia to Vietnam, stationed in Hanoi, between 1990 \u2013 1993. These were the middle years of Doi Moi, the period of Vietnamese economic reforms begun in 1986 that aimed at bringing about socialist market liberalisation. <SEPARATOR> Doi Moi marked a new phase of historical development for Vietnam as the nation began to chart its future.

This multidisciplinary project aims to use multiple research methods to understand early childhood development of Singaporean children. The research team includes scholars from seven disciplines - Sociology, Economics, Psychology, Geography, Social Work, Communications and New Media, and Demography. The aim is to examine how factors such as caregiving arrangements, preschool education, the roles of mother, father and extended family, cross-cultural family background, family resources, parenting behavior, living arrangements, family dynamics/relations, community, and government programs can affect children\u2019s social-emotional and cognitive development, health, and identity. <SEPARATOR> About the project <SEPARATOR> This project examines human development in Singapore by using innovative methods to understand factors that can promote Singaporean children\u2019s early childhood development.

However, this short-term programme gives students a valuable peek into the industry that they are interested in, and gain some exposure. <SEPARATOR> If you are keen to participate in the 3-month programme, look out for an email announcement, which will usually be sent out sometime in Mar/Apr. Students can then email the internship co-ordinator and ask to have a look at the folder containing details of all internship openings. If suitable positions are found, students can email the employer directly with their resume and cover letter, expressing their interest for the position(s). Short-listed students will be contacted directly by the employer(s) for interviews and other selection activities. <SEPARATOR> Pre-requisites For 6-Month Programme <SEPARATOR> The 6-month programme can fall on either semester: <SEPARATOR> Semester 1: Jul \u2013 Dec <SEPARATOR> Semester 2: Jan \u2013 Jun <SEPARATOR> Students receive 8 modular credits for modules <SEPARATOR> NM3550 <SEPARATOR> and <SEPARATOR> INM3550 <SEPARATOR> upon completion.

Employers will then be sent details of qualifying students, who will short-list students for their own interviews and selection process. <SEPARATOR> Supervision and Assessment <SEPARATOR> Students participaitng in the 6-month internship programme are assigned a <SEPARATOR> worksite supervisor <SEPARATOR> as well as an <SEPARATOR> academic supervisor <SEPARATOR> . The worksite supervisor will guide and mentor the student at the workplace, and is responsible for the final feedback on the student's performance during the 6 months. The worksite supervisor will also vet <SEPARATOR> weekly journals <SEPARATOR> that are submitted on a <SEPARATOR> monthly <SEPARATOR> basis to the academic supervisor. <SEPARATOR> The academic supervisor, on the other hand, will be in touch with the student throughout the internship and provide the student with guidance, especially in the context of applying theory to practice. The academic supervisor will also assess and grade the submissions, including the final report. <SEPARATOR> Assessment Criteria <SEPARATOR> Criteria Item <SEPARATOR> Weightage <SEPARATOR> Initial Report (500 words) <SEPARATOR> Monthly Journals <SEPARATOR> Final Report (3,000 words) and Presentation Slides <SEPARATOR> Feedback from Workplace Supervisor <SEPARATOR> Allowance <SEPARATOR> The department recommends a minimum monthly allowance of $1000.

By hiring CNM students, you also help develop the next generation of professionals. CNM is happy to offer two types of internships; a Compulsory Internship Programme that lasts 20 weeks and a 3-month internship that lasts 12 weeks. <SEPARATOR> Overview of COMPULSORY INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME <SEPARATOR> The 20-week internship takes place every year, in two periods: <SEPARATOR> Jan - May <SEPARATOR> Jul - Nov <SEPARATOR> Students earn academic credits when they participate in the Compulsory Internship Programme. <SEPARATOR> Overview of 3-month Internship <SEPARATOR> The 3-month internship takes place only once a year, during the May - July holidays, and lasts 12 weeks. Unlike the 6-month internship, students who participate in this shorter-term internship do <SEPARATOR> earn academic credits. <SEPARATOR> Allowance <SEPARATOR> The department recommends a minimum monthly allowance of S$1000. No CPF contributions are required. <SEPARATOR> Role of Employers <SEPARATOR> When a student joins the company, the employer is invited to appoint a <SEPARATOR> workplace supervisor <SEPARATOR> to guide and review the progress of internship. For the Compulsory Internship Programme, the workplace supervisor will need to evaluate and provide feedback on the student's performance at the end of internship. The workplace supervisor\u2019s feedback accounts for a significant part of the grade that the student will receive at the end of the internship. <SEPARATOR> Register to be an Employer <SEPARATOR> Employers who are keen to offer internships can register their internship vacancies in the semester prior to the internship period.

And then if you can afford it, also invest in (3) a computer and printer -- <SEPARATOR> Dell <SEPARATOR> has good deals, or go to the <SEPARATOR> Scholar's Workstation <SEPARATOR> and get one of the special deals offered to UCB students; get a reliable system, especially a printer that will print out when you want it to, without smudges, squiggly lines, or those other annoying features of the inkjet printer you've been nursing along since your sophomore year of high school; (4) decent software -- a way of connecting to the internet; either Word Perfect (yeah team!) or MS Word in their office suite so you can easily paste in tables and graphs; and some sort of software for doing data analysis, preferably <SEPARATOR> Stata <SEPARATOR> or some other package. Alternatively, open a <SEPARATOR> socrates <SEPARATOR> account with a faculty signature and you can use the analysis software available on socrates: Stata, SAS, SPSS and S-PLUS. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 1: Identify your interests <SEPARATOR> What topics do you enjoy thinking about? What sorts of economics news gets you excited? The best way to find out what you are interested in is not by reading economics journals. Instead, read the news. Talk to friends. Learn your family's history. Think about economic puzzles in real life. Then you'll be more likely to find a topic that can hold your interest for the next eight months. Write down everything that occurs to you in your research journal with your fancy new pen. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 2: Write up several topic ideas <SEPARATOR> Begin narrowing in on a specific researchable topic. Take two or three or four of the ideas that occurred to you when you were identifying your interests and, for each one, come up with answerable questions that emanate from the idea. Sketch out some ideas as to why this is an interesting question and an interesting topic not just to you, but to \"your readers\" (i.e., your parents and your faculty advisor). For each idea, write a one page (250 word) brief essay that sets out the topic idea, poses some answerable questions, and indicates why this would be an interesting topic to pursue. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 3: Do some preliminary library research <SEPARATOR> Now is when you go to the library. If you don't know how to make the library website work for you, go to one of their seminars and take notes. Using <SEPARATOR> EconLit <SEPARATOR> , <SEPARATOR> Social Sciences Citation Index <SEPARATOR> , the current contents index of <SEPARATOR> pathfinder <SEPARATOR> JSTOR <SEPARATOR> , and any other index that strikes your fancy (but not google.com), search for published literature that relates, directly or indirectly, to your topic. Look for books but mostly look for articles. Download them, copy them, check them out. Start reading, or skimming, them. What have economists said on related questions in the past? From what they've written, can you gain any insights into how better to approach your own topic? How to formulate your own answerable questions? Can you get some hints as to good data sets that can be used for your research? Can you figure out what are the \"classic\" articles that you should be sure to read? <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 4: For one topic, write answerable questions <SEPARATOR> Use the information you've gained from writing and thinking and reading about your potential topics to sift through and decide on just one topic. (Don't worry; you can always bail on this topic and start again from this step if in a few weeks you figure out that the topic you chose is untenable.) For the one topic you've chosen, come up with a series of answerable questions. Each question should be small, should have an answer, should be something you could answer. For instance, \"What caused the great depression?\" is not small, does not have an answer, and is not something you can answer. But \"What happened to total retail sales in Berkeley, Palo Alto, and Oakland -- two towns with a university and one without -- between 1929 and 1937?\" is small, has an answer, and is something you could answer. Write every question you can think of in your journal. Over time, you will sift through the questions and wind up answering just a handful of them. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 5: Identify a data set <SEPARATOR> For topics with an empirical component, you'll need data. For an undergrad thesis, most economics topics can be researched with publicly available data. Start at <SEPARATOR> FedStats <SEPARATOR> and find out what data sets are available from the U.S. federal government. Try <SEPARATOR> Lexis-Nexis Statistical Universe <SEPARATOR> . Be sure to look at the published literature so you know what data sets economists who have asked similar questions have used. Ask grad students or faculty in the field of your topic for advice on data. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 6: Download the data; play with it <SEPARATOR> By now, you need to be sure you have a computer that will do what you want it to do. Download the data. You can store it on your hard drive, you can store it on your <SEPARATOR> socrates <SEPARATOR> account, or you can store it on <SEPARATOR> webdisk <SEPARATOR> . Start playing with the data. To do so, you'll need to have some software installed. You can try to use Excel or Quattro Pro, but you will soon become frustrated. Try <SEPARATOR> Stata <SEPARATOR> , <SEPARATOR> , SPSS, SAS, or some similar program instead. Compute some means and standard deviations. Compute means and s.d.'s for relevant sub-populations of your data. Play with the data. Find quirky things about it. Find interesting puzzles in the data. Lose track of time, print out lots of output, drive your roommates nuts with your excitement over things like t-statistics and p-values. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 7: Do more reading; refine your questions <SEPARATOR> Now that you have started to play with your data and think about your topic, you can do more focused reading of the economics literature. Go back to EconLit and JSTOR; use the Social Sciences Citation Index; browse relevant journals. Take notes on what you read. Write down the full citation of everything you read so that you won't have to go back and find it next April. Use quote marks in your notes to indicate material that you have quoted word-for-word from a source so that you won't inadvertently plaigarize in your thesis. Use what you read and what you are learning to refine your answerable questions. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 8: Sketch out an economic model <SEPARATOR> Think like an economist. What is the question that you are asking? What are the factors that come into play? What decision is being made at the margin? What is the goal of the decision-maker? Can you break the problem down into demand factors and supply factors? Should you think about marginal cost and marginal benefit? At this point, you don't need equations, but you do need to be thinking in abstract terms, sketching out at least with words something that your faculty advisor could recognize as the beginning stabs at a model. Write it all down in your journal. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 9: Do some preliminary analysis <SEPARATOR> Now that you've thought more carefully about the economics of your question, laid out the factors that are relevant to the question you are asking, it is time to go back to your data and do some analysis. Can you run a simple regression that tries to get at the question? Print out your results and keep them in some organized fashion somewhere. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 10: Write a prospectus <SEPARATOR> A prospectus is a road map: what will you do for your thesis and how will you do it. For an undergrad thesis, it should be a 5 to 8 page paper (double spaced, 1 inch margins on all sides, pages numbered, jagged right, with a title, the subtitle of \"A Prospectus,\" and preferably a title page). It should begin with a statement of the topic and the questions to be asked, placement of the topic into the broader economics literature, discussion of why this is an interesting topic (without <SEPARATOR> ever <SEPARATOR> using the phrase \"This topic is interesting because . . .\"), critical review of what others have written on related topics, description of what you will do, description of your data set, presentation of some preliminary analysis, and a concluding paragraph. You should be able to use the prospectus in January to remind yourself of what you want to do, how, and why. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> STEP 11: Ask a faculty member to advise you <SEPARATOR> Although the department will offer an Economics H195B seminar in Spring 2003 for all students who cannot find an individual advisor, our hope is that most thesis students will hook up with a faculty member who will individually advise your thesis. The faculty member should be someone with an interest in your topic. Look at the Economics Department webpage or the Econ H195A webpage for a list of faculty research interests. The best way to ask someone to be your advisor is probably to introduce yourself with a brief (one screen, max) email, follow up with a visit to the faculty member's next office hour, have a brief conversation about your topic, and then ask the faculty member if she or he will serve as your thesis advisor during the spring term. Faculty members often like to have something to read; don't be surprised or put off if the professor says \"Give me your prospectus and I'll get back to you.\" In this case, though, it is ok to send an email five to seven days later to (again) ask the faculty member if he will be your advisor. Once someone says \"yes,\" then you'll just need to tell <SEPARATOR> Sandy Jaeger <SEPARATOR> who your advisor will be and she'll get you set up with the Econ H195B paperwork for the Spring 2003 term. <SEPARATOR> Back to top <SEPARATOR> Use your browser's \"BACK\" button to return to Econ H195A Home Page <SEPARATOR> Page prepared by <SEPARATOR> Prof. M.

Jointly, RC06 and RC41 aim to encourage family and demographic research of high quality. The theme of this conference is <SEPARATOR> \"CHANGING DEMOGRAPHY <SEPARATOR> CHANGING FAMILIES\" <SEPARATOR> Rapid demographic changes on a global scale such as population ageing, increased migration, and fertility decline have resulted in structural and normative shifts in the family system. Conversely, current family types and functioning affect demographic landscapes and trajectories. This conference seeks to bring together researchers to examine issues surrounding the bilateral relationship between family and demographic changes, factors shaping these changes and consequences of these changes. In addition to this main focus, we welcome papers that examine population dynamics and the relationship between population and family with other institutions. <SEPARATOR> Papers relevant to these themes are particularly welcome: <SEPARATOR> Children and youth <SEPARATOR> Non-normative families <SEPARATOR> Transition to adulthood <SEPARATOR> Gender <SEPARATOR> Aging and the life course <SEPARATOR> Formal demography <SEPARATOR> Education <SEPARATOR> Population dynamics <SEPARATOR> Comparative studies <SEPARATOR> Population and environment/development <SEPARATOR> Data and methods <SEPARATOR> State, family and population <SEPARATOR> Historical studies <SEPARATOR> Race and ethnicity <SEPARATOR> Network analysis <SEPARATOR> Labor force <SEPARATOR> Fertility <SEPARATOR> Migration and urbanization <SEPARATOR> Sexuality and reproductive health <SEPARATOR> Social capital <SEPARATOR> Family and household <SEPARATOR> Poverty and inequality <SEPARATOR> Family and work <SEPARATOR> Health and mortality <SEPARATOR> Marriage and union <SEPARATOR> Social safety nets <SEPARATOR> Submission of abstracts must be in English and made online at the conference website submission page (available from 1 July \u2013 1 November 2017). <SEPARATOR> The deadline for abstract submissions is 1 November 2017 at 5:00 p.m, Singapore Time (UTC/GMT +8 hours).

The event was a major success, with student exhibits wowing the viewers and engaging them in conversation and play. I am personally delighted to witness the creativity and artistic expression of our Media Design students. I am sure that those of you who attended the events will agree with me. <SEPARATOR> The event was opened by Janadas Devan, Chief of Government Communications for the Ministry of Communication and Information. The theme of this year\u2019s Random Blends is \u201cprocess,\u201d depicting the creative processes through which theory finds expression in practice. What you will experience today are the creative expressions of the abstract concepts, critical questions, and analytical frames that are conceptualized by our students. <SEPARATOR> In addressing the role of process in communication, I noted: \u201cCommunication for us is not only about the meanings we co-create, but also the values we come to imagine together as a community of scholars and practitioners.

Indonesia\u2019s successes in democratic consolidation within the context of a religiously pluralist state uphold that proposition in significant ways. Yet, as the twentieth anniversary of transition approaches, it is unclear whether civil pluralist voices retain their pre-eminence within discourses on Islam\u2019s relationship to state and society. Nor is it clear how Indonesia will reconcile the growing influence of Muslim conservative politics to the pluralist framework of the Pancasila state. These questions are not unique to Indonesia; rather, they animate intersections of Islam and democracy more broadly, and are evident in a diverse set of cases: from Tunisia to Turkey, and from Bosnia to Bangladesh. <SEPARATOR> This workshop re-examines Hefner\u2019s concept of civil Islam, and its relationship to democratization and pluralism, from the vantage point of 2017 \u2014nearly two decades on from transition. It examines the diverse and evolving role of Muslim activists, elites and organizations in democratization processes, both in Indonesia and comparatively. Conference panels will make reference to the work of Robert Hefner and the broader public religion literature, of which <SEPARATOR> Civil Islam <SEPARATOR> is a prominent example. Presentations in the workshop will explore various forms and manifestations of civil Islam (in politics, among social organizations, and in everyday life), as well as countercurrents among Indonesian Muslims. It will also consider the relevance of civil Islam to discourses on democracy and pluralism in other Muslim-majority states, such as Turkey, Tunisia, and Malaysia. <SEPARATOR> The workshop focuses on the following questions: <SEPARATOR> How prominent or influential is civil Islam today, some two decades after Indonesia\u2019s transition to democracy? What are the implications of an apparent conservative turn among Indonesian Muslims, as theorized by scholars and seemingly demonstrated in the recent Jakarta gubernatorial election, for the concept of civil Islam? <SEPARATOR> How do Indonesian political institutions and social organizations generate, sustain, or potentially undermine civil Islam as an approach or perspective on democracy and pluralism? <SEPARATOR> How relevant is the concept of civil Islam to discourses on democracy and pluralism in other Muslim-majority countries? <SEPARATOR> Given democratic setbacks in Turkey and Egypt, as well as ongoing debates over the limits to religious pluralism in Indonesia (most notably in the recent Jakarta gubernatorial election), this workshop is also extremely timely. This workshop is an opportunity for scholars to share their research, debate key concepts in the study of Islam and politics, and draw out implications of this research for Indonesia and other Muslim democracies. This workshop will contribute to a novel understanding of how civil Islam has transformed, been challenged, and contributed to democratization and the maintenance of religious pluralism in Indonesia and elsewhere. <SEPARATOR> This workshop will serve as a novel and timely contribution to comparative scholarship on Islam, democracy, and pluralism. It will deepens understandings of Islam\u2019s relationship to democracy and pluralism, as well as civil Islam\u2019s place within a democratic society that is paradoxically more stable and more prone to destabilizing identity politics. <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free, and seats are available on a first come, first served basis.

However, migrants\u2019 marriage behaviors, as one major life course event, are greatly reshaped by their migration experience as migration often occurs at a relatively early life stage and lasts for an extended periods of time. In this international conference, we aim to examine the relationship between migration and marriage in Asia. <SEPARATOR> Asia has witnessed tremendous increase and change in migration experiences. The changing distribution of migrants\u2019 skill qualifications have led to more heterogeneous motivations for migration and more dynamic assimilation processes. Compared to the previously dominant groups of low- or semi-skilled migrants, the increasing high-skilled migrants are more likely to have longer durations of migration and often have smoother and more active interactions with local residents in the receiving communities. They tend to seek new lifestyles beyond economic improvement, which include finding a spouse in the receiving communities and potentially settle permanently in the receiving community. Therefore, compared to their low- or semi-skilled counterparts, the high-skilled migrants may not only be more likely to thrive economically, but also be better assimilated into the receiving communities. <SEPARATOR> Moreover, migration often occurs at a relatively early life stage and lasts for an extended periods of time. Therefore, family formation behaviors, as one of the major markers of transitioning into adulthood, deeply relate to one\u2019s emotional satisfaction, taste preference, lifestyle options, as well as their socioeconomic prospects. Currently, relevant studies on the migration-marriage link had mostly been on western countries, while the migration-active Asia had not received sufficient attention. <SEPARATOR> Migrants across Asian countries face different institutional, policy, and cultural contexts that shape their marriage behavior. For example, in Singapore, cross-national marriages and inter-ethnic marriages are of significant interest; in China, how the Hukou system influences internal migrants\u2019 family formation behavior is uniquely important there; in India, how changes in the occupational distribution of the international migrants influence the marital choices are being intensely discussed; in Malaysia, diverse countries of origin of the migrants creates potential sources of tension and challenge for young adults in the marriage markets. In this conference, we are interested in examining how the experience of migration has influenced individuals\u2019 family formation behaviors under diverse policy and cultural contexts across Asia. We also seek to further our understanding on the mechanisms and issues that have been underlying the migration-marriage link. These include changes in economic well-being, cultural adaptation, and identity issues vis-\u00e0-vis marriages, and policies pertinent to cross-cultural marriages. <SEPARATOR> Theoretically informed empirical studies, especially those with cross-national and cross-temporal comparisons are welcome. Participants are invited to address the following themes in the conference: <SEPARATOR> Overall trends based on nationally representative data in migrants\u2019 marriage rates, age at marriage, intermarriage (across region, family SES, ethnicity, and the rural/urban divide), and divorce rates; <SEPARATOR> Migrants\u2019 attitudes toward marriage, family, and gender relations; <SEPARATOR> Relationship between migration and marriage timing, patterns of assortative mating, cross-cultural marriages, marital quality, marital dissolution, and potential mediating mechanisms; <SEPARATOR> How these relationships vary by migrants\u2019 socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender; <SEPARATOR> Policy considerations: how policies pertinent to cross-cultural marriages implicate on marriage patterns and family dynamics after marriage - including policies on fertility, education, elderly and child care, welfare, and migration; <SEPARATOR> Conceptual and methodological challenges: data source, measurement and definitions. <SEPARATOR> CONVENORS <SEPARATOR> Dr Zheng MU <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, and Centre for Family and Population Research <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> arimuz@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Prof Wei-Jun Jean YEUNG <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, Centre for Family and Population Research, and the Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> ariywj@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> SECRETARIAT <SEPARATOR> Ms Valerie Yeo <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> Valerie YEO <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "ariywj@nus.edu.sg", "Email 1": "valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg", "Email 2": "arimuz@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:01.906876"},

Asian countries (especially in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia) face demographic aging on different scales and at varied speeds. In this conference, we aim to address determinants of productive aging in Asia from a multilevel perspective to understand how communities, families and individual factors can facilitate engagement of older adults in Asia. <SEPARATOR> Using coresidence as an example to illustrate why family factors matter to older adults, cultural values of older adults living with family in later life are prevalent across Asian countries. However, declining coresidence rates and increasing numbers of golden agers living alone affect the motivation for and engagement in productive activities by older adults. Other family factors that also have an influence include intergenerational support to older parents, proximity between parents and children, and adult children\u2019s need of childcare. More studies are needed to research family factors in relation to productive aging in Asia. <SEPARATOR> Older adults generally spend more time in their residential communities than do younger adults, who go to jobs every day. Studies based on Western countries show that older adults in disadvantaged communities have difficulty being socially connected. It is because community contexts not only include infrastructure, facilities and space that help generate productive activities, but is also related to residential composition and social welfare resources that enhance older adults\u2019 motivation and sense of participation. It is important to investigate the impacts of community contexts on productive engagement in Asia. <SEPARATOR> Many Asian countries have had reforms in pension, long-term care and health care. Incentives related to productive aging are also implemented in developed countries. These differences in policies and institutional support across Asian countries indirectly influence the rates and intensity of engagement in productive activities across countries. <SEPARATOR> The two-day conference is a showcase of the diversity of productive engagement in later life across East Asian, Southeast Asian and South Asian countries. The selected empirical papers will analyse the determinants of old-age employment, volunteering, and care giving as well as lifelong education attendance. More importantly, we hope to disentangle socio-structural, cultural and institutional settings behind productive aging through direct and indirect comparative perspectives. <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free, and seats are available on a first come, first served basis.

Policy makers have shifted their interest to the forces that influence older adults\u2019 decisions on the timing of continued work and bridge job employment that is newly emerging trends. With extended life expectancy and the lack of social security fund for pension, old-age poverty rate has increased in recent years and many older adults tend to delay retirement or engage in bridge employment after retirement in East Asian, Southeast Asian and South Asian countries that traditionally emphasize individual's responsibility for preparing for retirement. <SEPARATOR> Studies have explored how the retirement decision-making process among older people is socio-economically stratified. Given that major norm of family behavior of Asia is filial piety and the decision of retirement timing is likely to be influenced by family circumstances, the association between intergenerational relationships and trends of older parents' labor force participation should be systematically examined. The old-age care services provided by the country and communities have been limited in many Asian societies although the role of adult children in supporting parents has been changed as they face rapid demographic transitions. Reduced co-residence rates and increased rates of elderly who live alone encouraged government to develop policies that target vulnerable older adults. Therefore, governments need to strategize how they can have a sustainable system to support a growing elderly population especially those who exit the labor force and are detached from family. studies that compare various systematic factors that affect early- and late- retirement would be important to develop sustainable pension and social security programs. Furthermore, longitudinal analyses of the socioeconomic impacts of deferring mandatory retirement on productivity among the elderly can extend theoretical perspectives in research fields such as social demography, public policy, sociology of family, and gerontology. However, the association between public old-age support, role of extensive family members, and retirement process has been less studied. Comprehensive examinations on the interrelations of the factors at multilevel that affect the transition processes from work to full retirement are necessary to this area. <SEPARATOR> The conference welcomes both qualitative and quantitative studies with cross-national, cross-sectional, or longitudinal survey analyses based on the aging population in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia. The main topics of the conference are the impacts of inter-generational relationships, family structure, cultural factors and policies on retirement and labor force participation among older populations in Asia. The following list includes some of topics that we expect papers to explore: <SEPARATOR> Definition and conceptualization of dynamic retirement process. <SEPARATOR> Exploring factors at individual- and family-level that may affect the transition processes from work to full retirement. <SEPARATOR> Comparative research that address country-level systematic differences in retirement process and social engagement among older adults. <SEPARATOR> Cross-level investigations that address the interactions among factors at macro-mess-micro levels in relation to work participation and healthy aging. <SEPARATOR> The relationships between the old-age support policies (e.g., pension and health care insurance), retirement timing, and private support. <SEPARATOR> CALL FOR PROPOSALS HAS ENDED <SEPARATOR> Notifications of acceptance will be sent out by end August 2017. <SEPARATOR> CONTACT DETAILS <SEPARATOR> Conference Convenors <SEPARATOR> Dr Lee Yeonjin <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> arileey@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Prof Yeung Wei-Jun Jean <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, Centre for Family and Population Research, and Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> ariywj@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Secretariat <SEPARATOR> Ms TAY Minghua <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> E | <SEPARATOR> minghua.tay@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> Minghua TAY <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "minghua.tay@nus.edu.sg", "Email 1": "arileey@nus.edu.sg", "Email 2": "ariywj@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:02.369615"},

The event also commemorates Singapore's 50 years of nation building and the University\u2019s 110th anniversary. <SEPARATOR> It is organized by the Centre for Family and Population Research and co-sponsored by the Singapore Research Nexus (SRN), Asia Research Institute (ARI) and the Department of Sociology, at the National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> Since Independence in 1965, Singapore has come a long way to become one of the most economically-developed countries in Asia today. Accompanying Singapore\u2019s economic transformation in the past five decades is the significant change in its social system and institutions, including the family. Changes in the demographic landscape, socioeconomic structures, technology and globalization have transformed family structure, attitudes about family formation, and relations among family members. These changes in family systems are manifested by the rise in age at marriage and singlehood rates, rapid decline of fertility, increase in divorce, cohabitation and inter-ethnic marriages, aging population, and a more diverse population in Singapore today. <SEPARATOR> As Singapore culminates half a century\u2019s history, it is timely to look back at the transformations in Singapore families and population, examine relevant policy responses, and reflect on future opportunities and challenges posed by these changes. <SEPARATOR> This conference brings together multi-disciplinary perspectives to examine the trends, determinants and consequences of changes in the well-being of Singapore families at different life stages as the country's population structure and composition evolve. <SEPARATOR> Themes that will be discussed in the conference revolve around the following: <SEPARATOR> 1. Population Dynamics and Family Relations <SEPARATOR> 2. Changes in Structure and Values in Singapore Families <SEPARATOR> 3. Children and Young Adults in Singapore <SEPARATOR> 4. Policies for Vulnerable Families in Singapore <SEPARATOR> 5. Future Research Opportunities and Challenges <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free, however registration is required.

Thompson <SEPARATOR> Department of Sociology, NUS <SEPARATOR> In this talk, I outline the conditions of a system of gender relations which I call \u201ctransnational patriarchy.\u201d Transnational patriarchy is a distinctive socio-cultural system, not merely a reproduction of pre-existing, traditional systems of patriarchy, such as \u201cclassic patriarchy\u201d described by Kandiyoti (1988). Classical patriarchy (found in agricultural societies of East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere) was primarily an effect of familial-corporate systems based on rules of patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence. The distinctive conditions of transnational patriarchy (as opposed to other forms of patriarchy) are nation-state practices of territorial sovereignty and citizenship. National territorialization creates zones of relative capital accumulation and deprivation. Regimes and practices of flexible citizenship (both by states and migrant individuals) produce citizenship rights that men employ as a resource (distinct from mere wealth) in negotiating conjugal relationships with women in the context of cross-border marriage migration. Women born into zones of relative social and material deprivation (frequently glossed as the \u201cThird World\u201d) likewise strategically trade on female resources of reproduction, sexuality, domestic labor, and heterosexual companionship in order to secure and improve their livelihoods and socioeconomic status. These conditions produce a distinctive, transnational \u201cpatriarchal bargain.\u201d Among other things, this framework (following Kandiyoti 1988) allows us to specify and theorize gender relationships and power in the context of socio-culturally framed \u201cpatriarchal bargains.\u201d It demonstrates the gendered effect of regimes of citizenship (even when they are otherwise apparently \u201cgender-neutral\u201d). And it allows us to move beyond the simplistic and problematic dichotomous tropes of \u201cwoman-as-victim\u201d (in the human trafficking paradigm) and \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d (in the global romance paradigm). The thesis will be substantiated with several examples, particularly of Thai migrant wives in Singapore and Filipina migrant wives in Japan. <SEPARATOR> Eric C. Thompson <SEPARATOR> is Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the National University of Singapore. Before joining NUS, he completed a PhD in sociocultural anthropology at the University of Washington and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies, University of California Los Angeles. He teaches anthropology, gender studies, urban studies and research methods. His research interests include transnational networking, urbanism, culture theory, and ASEAN regionalism. His work has appeared in the journals <SEPARATOR> American Ethnologist, Urban Studies, Political Geography, Asian Studies Review, Contemporary Sociology <SEPARATOR> , and <SEPARATOR> Contemporary Southeast Asian Studies <SEPARATOR> among others. He is author of <SEPARATOR> Unsettling Absences: Urbanism in Rural Malaysia <SEPARATOR> (NUS Press, 2007). <SEPARATOR> Differentiated Citizenship of Marriage Immigrants in Taiwan <SEPARATOR> Dr Melody Chia-Wen Lu <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, NUS <SEPARATOR> It has been argued that in many Asian countries, marriage immigrants are constructed as \u201cthe other\u201d, and their citizenship rights are granted or denied based on \u201ctraditional\u201d gender roles. Such citizenship regimes not only create social exclusion for marriage immigrants, but also provide the husbands, in-laws and the community at large the legitimacy to exercise control over them. <SEPARATOR> While I agree with the above statements, in this short presentation I will take a closer look at the mechanisms of exclusion and control by studying two aspects of international marriages: the specificity of citizenship regimes as well as the space for negotiation of marriage immigrants. Firstly, like many Asian countries, Taiwan adopts gender, ethnic and class selective criteria in its immigration policy, and as a result, marriage immigrants of various ethnicities enjoy different degrees and aspects of citizenship. What is the specificity of Taiwan\u2019s immigration and citizenship regimes (as compared to Singapore and other East Asian countries) towards international marriages? Secondly, the same citizenship regime that limits the rights of marriage immigrants may also provide opportunities for them to develop negotiation strategies. The interests of the state and the family are not always congruent. Being \u201cdifferent\u201d at times can be an advantage. <SEPARATOR> Taiwan has the highest percentage of international marriages in Asia, comprising nearly one third of all marriages nationwide in 2004. The majority of foreign spouses are women from the PRC, Vietnam and Indonesia. <SEPARATOR> Melody Chia-Wen Lu <SEPARATOR> is a Research Fellow (Asian Migration Cluster) at ARI. She received her PhD in Anthropology and Chinese Studies in Leiden University, the Netherlands, and taught at University of Amsterdam and worked as research fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies, the Netherlands. She is the co-editor of the book <SEPARATOR> \u201cAsian Cross-border Marriage Migration: Demographic Patterns and Social Issues\u201d <SEPARATOR> (co-edited with Yang, Wen-Shan, Amsterdam University Press). Currently she is working on Chinese female immigrants in Taiwan and South Korea, and participating in the ARI research project \u201cState boundaries, cultural politics, and gender negotiations in commercially arranged international marriages in Singapore and Malaysia, 2008 \u2013 2011\u201d <SEPARATOR> Customary Laws and Family & Migration Policies: Case of Vietnamese \u2013 Singaporean Marriages <SEPARATOR> Dr Vu Thi Kieu Dzung <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, NUS <SEPARATOR> In this discussion, I share some initial observations on the effects of customary laws and migration policies on the resettlement process of Vietnamese migrant wives in Singapore. <SEPARATOR> To improve the quality of population in Singapore (or to protect its \u201cgood quality population\u201d), migration policies aim to limit the in-flow of lowly-educated foreigners and their employment opportunities. As such, Singapore\u2019s family laws seem to be inadequate for the foreign spouse. Marriage immigrants are seen as \u201cforeigner\u201d, not as \u201cspouse\u201d, and the foreign wives with low education levels cannot enjoy the same rights as local spouses. Their residence status has to be sponsored by their husbands or their in-laws . Such migration policies provide a legitimate base for the men and their families to exercise rules of the patriarchal system. Foreign wives seem to have complete dependence on their husbands or their in-laws in their marriages. <SEPARATOR> On the other hand, the rules of the patriarchal system seem to be widely applied among this group of Singaporeans. The common perceptions and expectations of marrying Vietnamese wives are strongly associated with the patriarchal norms. Their relationships reflect practices of male dominance, patrilocal residence, patrilineal inheritance, or familial corporation. However, in their personal lives, there is a contradiction between what the men believe their relationships with their wives should be and what those relationships really are. In their daily activities, the wives create privacy and autonomy in their economic activities and interpersonal relationships, thus reducing the power of the parents-in-law and the husband over them. <SEPARATOR> Vu Thi Kieu Dzung <SEPARATOR> is a Visiting Research Fellow (Migration and Family Cluster) at ARI. She received her PhD in Sociology at the Michigan State University, USA. She taught at the department of Sociology, Vietnam National University and worked for Population Council, Hanoi, Vietnam.

Among them, the oldest-old population (age 80 and above) is estimated to quadruple to 114 million by 2050. The challenges of elderly care in China are unique due to dramatic social transformation resulting from major policy changes in the last five decades. While both private and public safety nets to the elderly have weakened in general, considerable inequality exists among subgroups in the population. This talk will highlight socioeconomic and policy factors that put some elderly at risk of social exclusion, measured by economic deprivation, social isolation, and social rights. Based on data drawn from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, I will examine the relationship between social exclusion and mortality rates. Implications of China\u2019s one-child policy, Hukou system, and the changing social contract for elderly care and intergenerational relations will also be discussed. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> W.

This is the result of people living longer combined with a very low birth rate. Most older Japanese are in good health, leading active lives, working, volunteering, caring for themselves and other family members. However, as people grow older health problems increase and they are more likely to need assistance in daily life. Caring for the elderly has traditionally been the responsibility of the family but with more Japanese living longer than before, the strain on the family has greatly increased. <SEPARATOR> The Japanese family today has also changed. More women, the usual caregivers, are working and the number of elderly living with their family members has decreased. In 1980, 70% of people over age 65 lived with their families compared to 44% in 2008. The proportion of older people living with a spouse rose from 20% to 37% and those living alone increased from 9% to 15%. During the same period, the government has developed programs for community and institutional care. In 2000, a national long-term care insurance program started, which greatly increased the number of services such as home helpers, day care and respite care. How has this affected the role of the family? How do older people respond to these services? I will present several family cases to illustrate how families have adapted to these new programs and how attitudes toward family care have changed. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> Ruth Campbell <SEPARATOR> has been working in the field of aging for more than forty years beginning as the leader of a senior citizens group in New York City. With a background in Social Work and aging, she has taught at the University of Michigan School of Social Work and Institute of Gerontology, and was professor at Tohoku Fukushi University (2002-2005). In Michigan, she also served as Associate Director for Social Work and Community Programs at the University of Michigan Geriatrics Center (1978-2006). Ruth began research on the elderly in Japan since 1976 and has continued through the years to study older people and their family relationships, caregiving and Japanese programs and services for the elderly. She has numerous publications on aging in Japan, her most recent research focused on Japan\u2019s national long-term care insurance and its impact on caregivers and care receivers. She is currently visiting scholar at Institute of Gerontology, the University of Tokyo and her current project is a life story project with older Japanese couples in which one of the spouses has dementia. <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free.

It analyses the meaning of marriage for men and women, the roles of men and women within marriage, shifts in marriage practices \u2013 particularly the shift from arranged to \u2018love\u2019 marriage \u2013 and unequal gender positions within marriage. We discuss some salient issues in the \u2018margins of marriage\u2019 in Indonesia: polygyny and constructions of masculinity that condone the practice of polygyny/affairs, and attitudes towards divorce, particularly for women. We then examine women\u2019s perception of the causes and triggers of domestic violence as revealed through fieldwork data, using the lens of women\u2019s agency. Our findings are that women perceive that their expressions of agency \u2013 for instance in challenging men\u2019s authority, moral righteousness and adequacy as breadwinners \u2013 are the most common triggers for male violence within marriage. Finally, we discuss the difficulty for women of escaping domestic violence, thereby getting some purchase on the relative capacity of women to resist, deflect or deal with the violence. The paper is a cautionary tale, warning feminists of a too facile positive interpretation of the expression of women\u2019s agency. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> Lyn Parker <SEPARATOR> is an anthropologist and Professor in Asian Studies at the University of Western Australia.

Trained in political science, her research focuses on intersections between urban and regional governance in the context of human conflict and environmental change. She leads the Disaster Governance theme of the Asian Urbanisms Cluster at ARI. Her interdisciplinary publications speak to contemporary theoretical debates and key policy issues in environmental disaster governance, decentralisation, urban change, and citizenship and belonging.

I do this by defining Asocial contexts as the experience of people born within a five year period and living in a particular country, using data from 270 national probability sample surveys from 42 nations that together cover the period 1905-1990. I show that the influence of parents' social status (education and occupational position) declines with successive transitions, and also over time equality of educational opportunity increased throughout the world during the 20th century. It also increases as nations develop, although state-socialist systems have particularly pronounced equality of opportunity, especially at the beginning of state-socialist periods. Six of the 42 nations in my data set are Asian: China, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. I conclude my talk by considering to what extent and in what ways Asian nations are distinctive. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> Donald J.

This annual series of public lectures is an opportunity for ARI to connect with the local Singapore community through informing and interacting with various public sectors (citizenry, government), civil society organizations, businesses, universities and colleges, by presenting cutting edge research on major trends in Asia. Some trends examined in the past include \"Women and Religion in Asia,\" \"Green Urbanism: How does Singapore compare?\" \"From Adolescent to Young Adulthood,\" \"Families, Children, and Domestic Workers in Contemporary Asia,\" \"Waxing Korean Wave in East Asia.\" Each ARI research cluster hosts an evening seminar, during which an overseas speaker, who is a prominent researcher or scholar, is invited to examine an emerging trend in that research field; a Singapore-based researcher then provides comments on local development with regard to the relevant trend. Past seminars have witnessed some interesting interaction between speakers and commentators; some have also seen lively audience participation in the discussions. ASIA TRENDS showcase the work of ARI's research clusters, highlights the relevance of ARI's research to Singapore, and relates Singapore to the rest of Asia from the perspective of significant trends in the region. <SEPARATOR> Click here for the <SEPARATOR> series listing <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free, however, registration is required.

Feminist theorists asserts that the patriarchal ideology and structure in society are the root causes of wife abuse. In particular, men\u2019s traditional gender attitudes are previously hypothesized as a risk factor of wife abuse. Nevertheless, the findings of previous research are inconclusive. This paper argues that past empirical studies often overly simplified the way how husband\u2019s gender attitudes are related to the risk of violence. This paper argues that the combination of husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s gender attitudes (i.e. the interaction effect of these variables) jointly affects the risk of violence. <SEPARATOR> Using data from a household survey in Hong Kong (N=871 couples, 1742 respondents), this paper shows that the effect of husband\u2019s gender attitudes on husband-to-wife violence (psychological, physical and sexual assault against wife) is conditional to wife\u2019s gender attitudes. The interaction of couples\u2019 gender attitudes plays an important role in shaping the risk of husband-to-wife physical assault. Non-traditional wives with traditional husbands face the highest risk of husband-to-wife violence, controlling for other factors. This finding is consistent to the motivational theories of spousal violence that conceptualized violence as a mean to control partner and to resolve conflict. This study also provides hints to partly explain the inconclusive findings of previous studies, which ignored the interaction between husband\u2019s and wife\u2019s gender role attitudes. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> Adam Cheung <SEPARATOR> is a postdoctoral fellow at the Changing Family in Asia cluster of Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore. He has received his PhD in Sociology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. His research and previous publications focus on the roles of social factors in domestic violence in the Chinese context.

It starts with the premise that the family is not only a site of production and reproduction but also of tension and conflicts, with violence among intimate partners as one of its manifestations. Among the many approaches to this issue is the feminist perspective which centralizes patriarchy as a root cause. Another is the behavioral approach which blames violence on personality-deficiency and the other is a family demographic approach which links multiple variables (from poverty to educational status) to the incidence of dysfunctionality. At the heart of the matter is also the failure or success of state intervention in attempting to regulate power and control within intimate relationships. By conceptualizing this issue as stemming from the ambiguity of family as private-public domain this workshop and its ensuing publication attempt to uncover some of the sources of the difficulties and paradoxes in understanding domestic violence as a legal as well as a cultural conundrum. <SEPARATOR> Some of the main reasons suggested for the emerging difficulties are, 1) domestic violence law is about regulating power and control in intimate relationships and therefore lacks a clear divide between the adversarial parties, 2) criminalizing domestic violence involves making the private public, hence entailing different positions among national states on this matter 3) the trauma of victimization among intimate family members raises dilemmas about how public disclosures could also be protected as private secrets, 4) the considerable gaps between cultural, religious and social realities with the intention and substance of the law itself and 5) legal ambivalences which treat domestic violence as both a civil as well as a quasi-criminal offence, a \u201cwrong\u201d which straddles being a crime and a moral transgression. <SEPARATOR> Confirmed keynote speakers are Professor Amirthalingam Kumaralingam, who is Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Law at NUS and Director of the Asian Law Institute, and Professor Renee Romkens, Chair of Interpersonal Relations, Tilburg University, Netherlands. <SEPARATOR> Other speakers include academics, researchers and social advocates on gender-based and domestic violence issues from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, China and South Korea. They will present papers which analyze current research findings and country case-studies or present critical perspectives in the understanding of the above issues. <SEPARATOR> CONTACT DETAILS <SEPARATOR> Workshop Convenor <SEPARATOR> Dr Maznah Mohamad ( <SEPARATOR> arimm@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute and Department of Malay Studies <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Secretariat <SEPARATOR> Miss Alyson Rozells <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> #10-01 Tower Block,469A Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 259770 <SEPARATOR> Email: <SEPARATOR> alysonrozells@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Tel: (65) 6516 8787 <SEPARATOR> Fax: (65) 6779 1428 <SEPARATOR> Kartini Asia Network <SEPARATOR> The Kartini Asia Network for Women's and Gender Studies was formally established in Manila in May 2003 after two years of preparation. Kartini, named after the Indonesian pioneering feminist writer and activist, aims to create synergy between women's/gender studies and feminist activism in the region. Kartini members are women's/gender studies centres or institutes and feminist organizations in Asia and elsewhere. The major objectives of the Kartini Network are to increase the knowledge base of the participating members, to strengthen their inter-disciplinary research skills, to contribute to the development of comparative and collaborative research programs that respond to the needs of women in the region and to create an open, flexible platform of exchange in the area of women's/gender studies between Asian scholars/activists working within academic institutes and in women's organizations through regular Kartini Network Asian Women's Studies conferences. Another issue Kartini members are concerned with is the training of gender trainers and policy-makers in the field of women's and gender issues at the operational level, sharing of methodologies and data exchange. Kartini strives to make Asian women's voices better heard in processes of nation-building and socio-economic development. The network also aims to incorporate women's rights in cultural and religious institutions and movements. <SEPARATOR> Kartini members have identified five major themes of particular interest to the Asian region: These themes have been the topics for the two Asian-wide conferences so far, in Dalian, China in 2004, and in Bali in 2008: <SEPARATOR> \u2022 women's and gender studies in Asia: historical perspectives and future challenges; <SEPARATOR> \u2022 struggles against fundamentalism and globalization; <SEPARATOR> \u2022 resistance against war, conflicts and violence; <SEPARATOR> \u2022 sexual rights and women's empowerment; <SEPARATOR> \u2022 livelihood and security. <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> ROZELLS Alyson Adrianne <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "arimm@nus.edu.sg", "Email 1": "alysonrozells@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:04.923483"},

Recent literature on the political and social economy of care apply the 'care diamond' conceptual framework to look at how care is produced and provided by the family, state, market and voluntary sector (including community) and how the relationships between these multiple institutions shift over time and across different national contexts. <SEPARATOR> Care in Asian countries is a relatively less studied topic. Simplistic classifications of the welfare regimes such as 'the Asian model' or 'familialistic' welfare regime seem to neglect the diverse care policies and practices which have been adopted over time in different Asian countries and regions. There is an urgent need for a collation of the available data on recent policy and practice changes in care provision for the elderly and young children in different regions and countries of Asia, and for an understanding of the implications of these changes. <SEPARATOR> The main objectives of this conference are (1) to examine how the boundaries of care provision for the elderly and young children have shifted between the family, state, market, and voluntary sector over time and across different national contexts in Asia; 2) to examine how recent policy changes in elderly care and child care in different regions and countries of Asia influence these boundaries shifts and vice versa; and 3) to explore the implications of these recent changes in care provision for social stratification by class and gender in Asia. <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Registration is required.

Our goal in this paper is to provide the first comprehensive analysis of educational differences in divorce in Japan. By focusing on education, we seek to evaluate the generality of growing differences observed in the U.S., to provide insights into the processes underlying the increase in divorce in Japan, and to speculate about the implications for patterns of stratification and inequality. <SEPARATOR> We use data from a large survey with retrospective marital history information to estimate educational differences in divorce and their change across marriage cohorts and data from a six-year panel survey to examine individual factors that may account for observed educational differences in divorce for recently married women. <SEPARATOR> Our preliminary results can be summarized easily. In both sets of analyses, we find a strong negative educational gradient in the risk of divorce \u2013 women with a two-year college degree or more are about half as likely as their less educated counterparts to divorce. We find no evidence that this difference has grown over time and it actually appears that the difference may be shrinking. Finally, it is clear that several potential explanations for the higher risk of divorce among the less educated \u2013 early marriage, a higher likelihood of marrying subsequent to pregnancy, and more rapid childbearing \u2013 do little to explain observed differences. <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> James Raymo <SEPARATOR> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he is also an affiliate of the Center for Demography and Ecology, the Center for Demography of Health and Aging, and the Center for East Asian Studies. Raymo\u2019s research focuses primarily on evaluating patterns and potential consequences of demographic changes associated with rapid population aging in Japan. He has published widely on key features of recent family change in Japan, including delayed marriage, extended coresidence with parents, and increases in premarital cohabitation, shotgun marriages, and divorce. In two other lines of research, he has examined relationships between work, family characteristics, and health outcomes at older ages in Japan and patterns of retirement and well-being at older ages in the U.S. He is currently involved in the early stages of a project that will examine family change and inequality in Japan in cross-national comparative perspective. His research has been published in top U.S. journals such as American Sociological Review, Demography, and Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences as well as in Japanese journals. Raymo teaches classes on Family and Household Demography, Demographic Techniques, and Research Methods. He is currently the Associate Director of Training at the Center for Demography and Ecology and the faculty director of the Sociology Department\u2019s Concentration in Analysis and Research. He also serves on the editorial boards of Demography and Journal of Marriage and Family. Raymo received his Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Michigan after completing his M.A. in Economics at Osaka City University in Japan. <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> Admission is free.

Hong Kong is no exception. Hong Kong has had a continuous population inflow from the Mainland: refugees in the 1950s and 1960s, \"new immigrants\" in the 1970s and 1980s, and now the \"new arrivals\" since Hong Kong's reunification with China in 1997. Today, 150 legal immigrants from the Mainland arrive daily in Hong Kong, many of whom are children aged 18 or below. How Mainland children adapt to the Hong Kong educational system is a major concern to scholars and policymakers. This project examines the academic progress of Mainland Chinese immigrant students in Hong Kong\u2019s secondary schools. Our database is the Medium of Instruction Longitudinal Survey of a cohort of Form 1 (Grade 7) students in 1999-2000 from a representative sample of Hong Kong secondary schools. These students were tracked until their final year of high school in 2004-05. Their examination results at the end of high school are crucial for their entry into college. This project addresses three research questions: 1) how did Mainland students perform in various school subjects compared to their native counterparts at the beginning of secondary school? 2) If achievement inequality existed at the beginning of secondary school, was it reduced or exacerbated over time? 3) Was the achievement gap by nativity explained by students\u2019 family background and school characteristics? 4) Compared with native Hong Kong students, were Mainland high school graduates equally eligible to enter college? 5) How did their previous achievement, after controlling for family and school factors, influence their college access? <SEPARATOR> ABOUT THE SPEAKER <SEPARATOR> Suet-ling Pong <SEPARATOR> is Professor of Education and Demography, and has a courtesy appointment in Sociology at the Pennsylvania State University. Currently she is Visiting Professor at the Department of Educational Administration and Policy, Faculty of Education, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Pong's research is in the field of sociology of education. Her work centers on the relationship between family structure and children\u2019s education, parental practices and involvement, education policies, and race/ethnic and immigration issues in education. Pong\u2019s work is often internationally focused. She has conducted comparative research in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, the United States and the countries that participated in TIMSS (Trends in Math and Science Study) and PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). Her research can be found in journals such as <SEPARATOR> Sociology of Education <SEPARATOR> Journal of Marriage and the Family <SEPARATOR> Social Science Quarterly <SEPARATOR> Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis <SEPARATOR> Comparative Education Review <SEPARATOR> , and <SEPARATOR> Child Development <SEPARATOR> . Pong has been a Spencer Residence Fellow, a Fulbright Research Scholar, a Spencer / National Academy of Education Postdoctoral Fellow, and a Population Council Postdoctoral Fellow.

The Forum for Asian Studies at Stockholm University and the Asia Research Institute have also offered financial support for the workshop. <SEPARATOR> This workshop takes the concept of <SEPARATOR> migration infrastructure <SEPARATOR> as a starting point for conceptualizing new regimes of transnational migration across Asia and the Middle East. These regimes are characterized by growing demands for documentation (i.e. the production of passports and no objection certificates) and stringent immigration controls, as the role of state actors in the migration process has become more extensive. At the same time, the development of flexible labor markets characterized by sub-contracting and the privatization of migration management means that intersections between state and market actors are increasingly complex on local, national, and transnational scales. In this context, a wide range of institutionalized services and facilities\u2014such as medical checkups, surveillance systems, temporary housing, migrant training, transportation, terminals, as well as the production of documents\u2014form the basis for contemporary flows of migration. <SEPARATOR> Transnational migration <SEPARATOR> is increasingly managed through infrastructural development as opposed to the control of bodily movement per se <SEPARATOR> . We therefore offer <SEPARATOR> migration infrastructure <SEPARATOR> as a conceptual alternative to <SEPARATOR> migration industry <SEPARATOR> (Castles and Miller 1998). While the latter highlights the importance of actors and institutions involved in the business of migration\u2014in contrast to state attempts to regulate migration flows and the experiences of migrants themselves\u2014migration infrastructure suggests an approach that engages with the services and facilities that make migration possible in the context of an increasingly complex relationship between state and market. <SEPARATOR> Infrastructure is ecological and relational and must be understood in the context of organized practices across time and space (Star 1999). Although generally understood as mundane and taken-for-granted, infrastructure can also take the form of spectacle, particularly in the context of introduction, upgrade, and breakdown, as, for instance, with the rise of online biometric technologies. But infrastructure is also commonly patchwork, as in the ad hoc transformation of residential into temporary migant housing. Approaching infrastructure in ethnographic terms continues our ongoing concern with opening the black box of migration (Lindquist, Xiang, and Yeoh 2012), namely the middle space between departure and arrival. In this workshop we invite participants to engage with some aspect of migration infrastructure in ethnographic terms. The embedded nature of infrastructure means that it is difficult to mark a beginning or an end. <SEPARATOR> As a heuristic, however, an ethnography of infrastructure allows us to approach the organization and structure of migration in novel ways and unpack widely used terms such as \"flow\" and \"channel\". In line with this, we hope to receive papers that deal with a wide range of perspectives on migration infrastructure.

On the one hand, wealth floods into the construction and rebuilding of religious places. On the other, the widening gap between the rich and poor, metropolitan centers and rural margins has increased the needs for development projects that are able to re-distribute the wealth to a certain degree. Meanwhile, as the Chinese government leads the country from planned economy to market economy, it has also shed some of its burdens of social welfare provision, thus leaving room for other social actors to participate in the field of delivering social services. Among those actors who find themselves in the new space of public engagement, religions not only provide valuable social capital for identifying the needy, organizing volunteers and distributing goods, but also provide salient spiritual and cultural meaning for people\u2019s actions. Historically, Chinese charitable institutions often take the form of lineages, business associations and locality groups. Present-day developmental and philanthropic organizations in China often take the secular forms of NGOs such as the One Foundation (set up by the Chinese actor Jet Li) or GONGOS such as United Association for Chinese Charity, under the Ministry for Civil Affairs. The role religions play in development is under-studied. This does not mean, however, that they do not exist. On the contrary, the intersection of religion and development in contemporary China is very active, innovative and diverse, taking various forms. <SEPARATOR> One of the features of religions\u2019 involvement in development in China is innovation. Not only do religious individuals and institutions invent new ways of giving, mobilizing and organizing people, individuals adopt new ways of adhering to religions, local and central government also has to forge new ways of managing or collaborating with religious organization. Of course, these innovations do not mean that there are no historical continuities. On the contrary, religious groups and individuals often invoke theological roots and historical practices of charity in their tradition to achieve legitimation. This InterAsia Round Table will examine such contemporary innovations in the field of religion and development in China in order to understand the implications for the reconfiguration of religious groups, renegotiation of state-religion-society relationship, and the reshaping of new kinds of subjectivities in China. <SEPARATOR> Questions for discussion at the roundtable include: <SEPARATOR> - To what extent does the involvement of religious individuals and institutions in development change governance or force different levels of governments to reconsider their responsibilities to people as well as relationships to religious organizations? Does the fact that religious organizations are shouldering some of the burdens of the government in providing social welfare necessarily mean the state enforce less strict control over religious groups? While religious groups are often vested with more trust in developmental projects, does this push local government to be more accountable? <SEPARATOR> What are the factors affecting religious groups\u2019 involvement in social service provision and the extent to which their involvement differ: theology, scale, organizational structure, competition (relationship with other groups and with the state)? <SEPARATOR> How do religious groups and individuals conceptualize what it means to be needy and who is worth helping? How do these discourses relate to, negotiate or contradict the state discourses of social welfare as well as the popular/quasi-Buddhist cultural understanding of charity and merit accumulation? How do these discourses interact with the global modern/western/Christian discourses of poverty, development, equality, etc <SEPARATOR> - What are changing faces of religious giving in China in the past thirty years? Are we witnessing a trend from non-institutionalized (e.g., temple based) giving to institutionalized giving, one-time spontaneous/sporadic giving to routinized/normalized giving? What are the implications of such changes? <SEPARATOR> - How does involvement in development change the way religious groups envision themselves and how religions are viewed in China at large? Are there \u201cunethical\u201d giving? How do religions deal with charity to atheists or people with different religious affiliation? Some religious groups may refrain from involvement in development because it dilutes spirituality and leads to secularization. How do we understand religion and development in light of the current debates on religion and secularity? <SEPARATOR> REGISTRATION <SEPARATOR> This event is by invitation only. <SEPARATOR> Interested participants, please contact Ms Valerie Yeo at <SEPARATOR> valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> CONVENORS <SEPARATOR> Dr Wu Keping <SEPARATOR> , Asia Research Institute, NUS <SEPARATOR> Assoc Prof Michael Feener <SEPARATOR> , Asia Research Institute & Department of History, NUS <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> Valerie YEO <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:28.621722"},

Invited presenters will examine the trends and determinants of one-person households in Asian countries as well as the well-being of those who live alone. Based on data from censuses, surveys, or indepth interviews, these studies use either quantitative or qualitative methods to investigate the main theme of this conference in about a dozen countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asian and West Asia. Several studies involve longitudinal or comparative analyses. <SEPARATOR> Family structure in Asia has undergone significant changes in the past several decades. A fast-growing trend that has raised concerns by scholars and policy makers is an increase in one-person households. By 2020, it is estimated that four out of the top ten countries with highest number of one-person households in the world will be in Asia. The increase raises questions regarding how family functions, and indeed regarding the definition of family system itself. Statistics show a high level of heterogeneity among groups who live alone, some by choice, others out of needs. The increasing number of one-person households for both young adults and elderly warrants special attention as they are the two groups with the highest propensity to live in a one-person household. This group of population may be at higher risk of financial stress or social isolation. In particular, studies on solo-living of young adults are rare in the Asian context. In the face of vastly different paces of change, structurally and culturally, in the region, systematic research that examines the trends of one-person households in different Asian societies will help us gain new knowledge about the impacts of social changes on families across Asia. <SEPARATOR> CONTACT DETAILS <SEPARATOR> Organizers <SEPARATOR> Prof Wei-Jun Jean YEUNG <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, and Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Dr Adam Ka-Lok CHEUNG <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> arickl@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Secretariat <SEPARATOR> Ms Valerie YEO <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> #10-01 Tower Block, 469A Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 259770 <SEPARATOR> Email: <SEPARATOR> valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Tel: (65) 6516-5279 <SEPARATOR> Fax: (65) 6779-1428 <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> Valerie YEO <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "valerie.yeo@nus.edu.sg", "Email 1": "arickl@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:32.055119"},

Most often, however, these discussions have been compartmentalized within fields of study focused on a single religious tradition. This workshop seeks to open new lines of conversation by bringing together scholars working on Buddhist monastic lineages, Sufi tariqas, and Christian orders in Southern Asia, to bring their own specialized research into conversation with recent developments in the broader field of trans-regional history. The workshop seeks to understand better the motivations for extending religious communities geographically in the southern Asian region, as well as conceptions of affiliation that have shaped the movement and localization of religious specialists. The workshop will also explore the ways in which the presence of religious orders shaped processes of recognition and competition within and across the expansionary religious traditions of Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. <SEPARATOR> CONTACT DETAILS <SEPARATOR> Workshop Convenors <SEPARATOR> Assoc Prof Michael Feener <SEPARATOR> arifm@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Cluster Leader, Religion and Globalisation in Asian Contexts, Asia Research Institute <SEPARATOR> & Department of History, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Prof Anne M.

This conference was co-organized by Robin Bush, Philip Fountain and Michael Feener, and jointly-funded by the Henry Luce Foundation and the Asia Research Institute. <SEPARATOR> The event was well-attended, attracting an audience of over 100 people, including scholars from multiple disciplines and universities in the region, practitioners from a range of development and humanitarian organizations also spanning the region, civil servants, and students. It began with introductory remarks by the organizers, calling attention to recent shifts in the geo-politics of development assistance and the power imbalances that still mark the fight against poverty. The organizers called for an introduction of analysis of \u2018religion\u2019 in conversations on the politics of poverty, and discussions of ways in which development and religion are mutually constitutive. Both days of the conference began by a dialogic keynote panel in which two senior scholars made substantial presentations, followed by commentary and discussion. On the first day, the keynote session, featuring Katherine Marshall and Jeff Haynes, focused on \u2018Development Actors\u2019, and on the second day, the keynote session, featuring Carole Rakodi and James Putzel, focused on \u2018the Role of the State\u2019. Following each keynote session on each day were parallel break-out panels in which 18 scholars presented papers across the broad sub-themes of: \u2018Transnational Religious Actors\u2019, \u2018Humanitarians and Religion\u2019, \u2018Interrogating Religion\u2019, \u2018Entanglements with the State\u2019, \u2018Engaging Islam\u2019, and \u2018Secularity\u2019. These sessions featured rich, empirically grounded material from case studies on the nexus of religion, development, and politics in diverse contexts across East, South, Southeast, Central, and West Asia. A number of the papers presented by junior scholars were particularly strong, with exciting new data and rich analytical frames being presented and discussed. <SEPARATOR> One of the foremost objectives of the organizers was that this conference would facilitate conversations not just among scholars, but also with development practitioners\u2019 as integral elements of the discussions. As such, one of the innovations of the conference design was a Practitioner\u2019s Panel \u2013 held as the capstone session on each day of the conference. In these panels, 8 senior development practitioners representing OECD, AusAID, ICRC, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, The Asia Foundation, World Vision, Save the Children, and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, NUS, shared their insights into the role that religion plays in various aspects of development. On the first day, the practitioner panel focused on discussions of development policy, and on the second day, it focused on grounded and field-based experience. Many people remarked on the practitioner panels as being a forum that worked remarkably well, and that were a highlight of the conference. The debate and interaction between practitioners and scholars was not just limited to these panels, however \u2013 it prevailed throughout all of the sessions of the conference, and indeed became a primary theme of discussion. That is, the \u2018bridge building\u2019 objective of the conference became a point of discourse itself, and as a point of dialogue was enthusiastically embraced by participants. Points of potential collaboration that were identified included the need for more rigorous data and evidence, the need for systematic and detailed mapping, and the need for comparative case studies. In terms of networking, both practitioners and scholars mentioned their appreciation for the opportunity to meet and connect with cross-disciplinary colleagues. <SEPARATOR> Across the two days of the conference, a number of key themes emerged as prevalent talking points. One of these was the broad disjunction between many scholars, who felt there was a \u2018resurgence\u2019 of interest in religion in development studies and social science more broadly, and some practitioners who were more ambivalent about engagement with religion. Another frequent theme was the lack of data or evidence on how engagement with religion affects development outcomes, and vice-versa-- how engagement with development shapes religious institutions and identities. A third point of discussion was the complex and varied relationship between the state and religion in differing historical and political contexts, and ensuing implications for citizen welfare. While the goal of the conference was not to arrive at a general consensus or overarching conclusions, generally it was felt that the provocative conversations enabled a more nuanced and complex understanding for both scholars and practitioners about how religion, politics, and development interact. Conference organizers are in the process of compiling some of the papers presented at the event into an edited volume. <SEPARATOR> CONTACT DETAILS <SEPARATOR> Conference Conveners <SEPARATOR> Dr Robin BUSH <SEPARATOR> arirb@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Dr Philip FOUNTAIN <SEPARATOR> aripmf@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Secretariat <SEPARATOR> Mr Jonathan Lee <SEPARATOR> jonathan.lee@nus.edu.sg <SEPARATOR> Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore <SEPARATOR> Contact Person(s) <SEPARATOR> LEE Ming Yao, Jonathan <SEPARATOR> Stay in touch with us <SEPARATOR> \u00a9 Copyright 2001- <SEPARATOR> National University of Singapore. <SEPARATOR> All Rights Reserved. <SEPARATOR> Terms of Use <SEPARATOR> Privacy <SEPARATOR> Non-discrimination <SEPARATOR> Home <SEPARATOR> Careers <SEPARATOR> Site Map <SEPARATOR> Contact <SEPARATOR> Last modified on 08 October, 2017 by Office of Corporate Relations", "crawled_email_list": {"Email 0": "arirb@nus.edu.sg", "Email 1": "aripmf@nus.edu.sg", "Email 2": "jonathan.lee@nus.edu.sg"}, "last_updated": "2017-10-08 21:28:38.827593"}

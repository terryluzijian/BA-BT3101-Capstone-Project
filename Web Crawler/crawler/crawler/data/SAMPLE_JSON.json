He joined the University of Hong Kong in 1998, maintaining his research in skeletal biology using mouse as a model to address disease mechanisms , as well as human genetic studies to define genetic risk factors for common degenerative skeletal conditions such as intervertebral disc degeneration. His research contributed to the molecular understanding of many forms of the human osteochondrodysplasias. In recognition, he was presented with \u201cThe Premier\u2019s Award for Health & Medical Research in Victoria, Australia; and more recently, he received the Croucher Senior Fellowship from the Croucher Foundation as recognition of his contribution to skeletal research in Hong Kong. My research interest is in skeletal biology, focusing on development, growth and degenerative processes of the skeleton in health and disease. The emphasis is on genes regulating the linear growth of long bones, the formation of a synovial joint, and the intervertebral disc of the spine. The approach is to identify novel disease genes and to model the disease in mice to define the precise molecular and developmental changes. In addressing the molecular basis for metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS), a human condition with an abnormal growth plate causing dwarfism, we showed that the consequence is from activating ER-stress signal in hypertrophic chondrocytes that induces a \u201creprogramming\u201d event, and the cells become \u201crejuvenated\u201d (11, 12). At present, we are focusing on defining the relationship between activation of ER-stress and other cellular processes including hypoxic stress signals in an integrating with cellular metabolism. Understanding this \u201creprogramming\u201d progress not only has implications in the control of chondrocyte differentiation, but also regenerative strategies for degenerative cartilage diseases. A related goal is to understand the signals controlling joint formation, with an emphasis in the formation of digit joints. In address the molecular consequence of brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1), we provided novel insights into how mutations in the gene alter the signaling capacity and range of hedgehog proteins, as these mutations impair IHH interaction with partner molecules (9). The consequence is reduced digit outgrowth in development causing brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) with a genetic interaction with non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway through the Ror2 receptor (6). The impact of these and copy-number variation mutations in the locus (3) showed the important of precise temporal and spatial hedgehog signals for proper skeletal development. We research maintains an interest in the molecular signals that regulate joint formation with an emphasis on their regulation of progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation in the synovial joint formation. I coordinate a Human Genetic Research Programme aiming to identify genetic risk factors for intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, a major cause of back pain. The aim is to understand the etiology of disc degeneration and a mean derive new strategies in the prevention and treatment of the disease. Through a candidate gene approach, we showed that Asporin as a new genetic risk factor for intervertebral disc degeneration (10), and more recently, using a combination of family linkage and genome-wide association analysis, we identified CHST3 as a novel risk factor with links to miRNA function (1). CHST3 is an important enzyme in the disc for the proper function of matrix proteins to attract water. We also use mouse as a model to understand the molecular and cellular basis of the risk factors. As such, we are interested in the developmental processes of the IVD with a focus on the impact of the risk factors altering the environmental niche of cells and potential progenitor cells in the IVD, leading to the degenerative process. As my area of my expertise is in the extracellular matrix proteins; a new direction in my lab is to use the regenerative Planarian as a model organism to study the extracellular matrix niche of stem cell maintenance. Planarians have extraordinary potentials to regenerate missing body parts that could provide vital clues for the developing of novel regenerative strategies. Song, Y. Q., Karasugi, T., Cheung, K.

These enzymes often require supramolecular organization and complex architecture to function. For example, both the ribosome and some non-ribosomal peptide synthetases use more than 100,000 atoms to make peptide bonds, while the proteases that break these bonds can be very small. Of course, these assemblies require regulation, processivity and fidelity, which contribute to their increased size. Our lab investigates both the manner by which cellular machines achieve these roles, and the mechanisms of their principal functions. To do this, we combine X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and biochemical techniques. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are large macromolecular machines that also catalyze peptide bond formation. Instead of making proteins, these enzymes produce a large variety of small molecules with important and diverse biological activity. For example, NRPSs synthesize anti-fungals, anti-bacterials, anti-virals, anti-tumourigenics, siderophores, and immunosuppressants including well-known compounds such as penicillin and cyclosporin. NRPSs use assembly line logic, with dedicated active sites for each amino acid added to the peptide. Single subunit NRPSs can be over 2 megadaltons, and are nature\u2019s largest known enzymes. The ribosome is the cell\u2019s protein factory. It translates the genetic information in mRNA into protein, rapidly and with high fidelity, using aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates. A large number of accessory protein factors are necessary for in vivo protein synthesis, and the interplay between these factors and the ribosome is extremely complex. Deregulation of protein synthesis in humans in associated with cancers, and many important antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome.

In this role he is consulting with the UK energy research community to develop a consensus around a research agenda, to build an inter-disciplinary research consortium and plan a programme of research with a view to a new End Use Energy Demand Centre starting in April 2018. , which is undertaking research on the combined, technical, economic, social and policy issues in moving to electricity systems with very high levels of variable renewables. Nick has been Programme Leader for Energy in the ECI since 2007, but is currently seconded out of that post to the End Use Energy Demand Champion role. From 2007 to 2017, he was a Co-Director of the multi-university collaboration, the UK Energy Research Centre, leading its research work on energy demand (2007-2014) and decision-making (2014-2017). He was a Co-Investigator within the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium from 2011-2017. Nick has worked as a researcher, consultant and manager on energy and environmental issues since 1984. His interests focus on energy policy, especially with respect to energy demand, energy efficiency and the transition to low carbon energy systems. He has published extensively on energy, climate, environment and transport issues. He is co-author of a book on carbon markets. Nick worked at the Energy Saving Trust from 1999 to 2007, initially as Head of Policy and, from 2002, as Director of Strategy. He was responsible for the Trust's work on public policy issues, business development and long term business strategy. In 2001, he was seconded to the Cabinet Office, Performance and Innovation Unit, where he was a co-author of the Government's Review of Energy Policy. He led work streams on energy efficiency and long term energy scenarios. Previously, Nick worked as a researcher and analyst on energy and environment issues, initially in the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU) and then as an independent consultant. He was one of the UK's first researchers on mitigation of carbon emissions, and was co-author of a presentation to the Cabinet on this issue in 1989. In 1997, he wrote the first published study on how the Government's 20% carbon emission reduction target might be delivered. He has advised successive Government ministers and a wide range of Parliamentary inquiries. He managed a large European Commission programme on the external costs of energy and was lead author of the report used as the basis for the UK Government's first estimate of the social cost of carbon. Nick holds an MA in Physics and D.Phil in Nuclear Physics from the University of Oxford. He is a Fellow of the Energy Institute and an Honorary Fellow of the Society for the Environment. He was a County Councillor in Oxfordshire from 1987 to 1993, taking an active role in the development of Oxfordshire's first environmental strategy, traffic calming, CFC capture and opposition to new road building. Nick's long term research interest is the role of public policy in reducing energy demand and carbon emissions, in the context that progress will require a combination of technical, social and policy change.

We are interested in applying a chemical biology approach to three research areas: (I) The first is to dissect and further elucidate the process of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Small molecule ligands, acting as inhibitors, have provided formidable insight into the complexity of prokaryotic translation. We propose that similar inhibitors of eukaryotic translation will be valuable tools to better understand the intricacies and regulation of this pathway. Moreover, only from a more complete picture of eukaryotic protein synthesis can one obtain the necessary means to design therapies that target translation to treat disease. In sum, our research program is aimed at identifying inhibitors of mammalian translation, elucidating their mode of action, and identifying their molecular targets. (II) The increasing awareness of the essential role of RNA in many biological processes and in the progression of disease makes it a very attractive therapeutic target. RNA plays an essential role in many macromolecular processes (sometimes contributing catalytic activity), contains complex secondary and tertiary structural folds, and lacks a cellular repair mechanism. Targeting RNA has also the potential to regulate gene expression in fashions not available by current drug strategy approaches - for example, to achieve allele-specific modulation of gene expression (when allelic sequence differences result in altered RNA conformations) or isoform-specific modulation of gene expression. One of our research efforts is to target specific RNA motifs involved in disease with small molecule ligands to perturb gene expression. (III) We are also interested in better understanding changes in gene expression that occur during the transformation process. We have been characterizing the biochemical properties of a tumor suppressor gene, WT1, a gene that is mutated in Wilms' tumor - a pediatric malignancy of the kidney. As such we have characterized structure/function relationships of WT1, characterized several of its downstream targets, and shown a role for the product of this gene in normal urogenital development. We have also characterized genetic events involved in the progression of this disease. An important aspect of cancer progression is angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessel to bring nutrients to transformed cells. Current work in the lab is geared towards better understanding the process of angiogenesis in cancer by studies aimed at post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in this event.", "tag": "aspirant"},

More recently his interests have expanded to include the impacts and limitation of tropical deforestation. in Meteorology from the University of Reading. His early post-doctoral work at the University of Edinburgh focused on measuring ecosystem carbon fluxes from pristine Amazonian rainforests, and this led to a deeper interest in the ecology and dynamics of tropical rainforests. In 2000 he co-founded the Amazon rainforest forest inventory network (RAINFOR) which has been revealing fundamental new insights into the biogeography of Amazonian forests, and how they are responding to global atmospheric change. He was a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Edinburgh University between 1999 and 2004. In 2005 he was appointed a University Lecturer at the School of Geography and the Environment, in 2006 he became Reader in Terrestrial Ecology, and in 2007 Professor of Ecosystem Science.

He is also a member of various committees including: the Royal Society Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Ocean Acidification; the Royal Society Committee on Science in Society; and the Scientific Steering Committee of the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia. He has delivered invited seminars/plenaries in numerous universities, including Harvard, UCLA, Berkeley, Duke, Cambridge, and Brasilia. He was the editor of a thematic issue of , and has been a contributing author to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group 1 and the organiser of major multidisciplinary international conference: The major focus of his work is understanding the interactions between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere. This includes the cycling of carbon, water and nutrients, the climatic controls on ecosystem metabolism and biomass, and more recently, assessing the impacts of land use change and the potential of forest protection to mitigate global climate change. His research techniques combine the diverse disciplines of ecological and forest field surveys, ecophysiological measurements, micrometeorological field techniques, satellite remote sensing, vegetation-atmosphere modelling, and social science. He has a particular interest in tropical forests ranging from Malaysia to the Congo and Zambia, but especially in Amazonia and the Andes. Since 2006 he has been engaging in a major study looking at an elevation transect in the Amazon-Andes, ranging from 200m to 3600m in elevation, and has ongoing research interests across the lowland forests of Amazonia through the RAINFOR project. More recently he has embarked on an expanding programme of research looking at the functioning and climatic response of temperate woodlands of the Upper Thames. Prof. Malhi teaches on biodiversity and ecosystem assessment techniques for the MSc in Biodiversity Conservation and Management.

After postdoctoral training in in Karolinska Institute, he joined the department as a Research Assistant Professor in 2002 and became Associate Professor in 2005. He has published more than 40 original papers, reviews and book chapter. He is the co-founding Chair of Asian Association of Aging Research. Prof Zhou is interested in understanding the biological functions of extracellular and nuclear matrix proteins. He works on signaling regulation in development, aging, and tumorigenesis using genetically modified mice and human patient tissues. He identified lamin A as the endogenous substrate of metalloproteinase Zmpste24 and demonstrated for the first time that genomic instability is behind the most severe human early aging disease, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). He has demonstrated that nuclear matrix is not simply a scaffold but a functional structure in regulating chromatin dynamics through modulating epigenetic factors, such as histone deacetylases and acetyltransferases. An example of Zhongjun\u2019s work that breaks new ground in the science of aging is his recent demonstration of resveratrol\u2019s activation of the longevity protein SIRT1. He demonstrated that lamin A is an endogenous activator of SIRT1 and mediates the activation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity by resveratrol. This important finding clears the cloud over resveratrol as the activator of SIRT1. His works on healthspan extension provide new hope for patients with HGPS and aging-associated diseases. He is a well recognized internationally in the field of biology of aging. He has also made significant contributions to the understanding of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase function in development and signaling. He demonstrated that MT1-MMP is the major negative Notch signaling regulator to maintain lymphocyte differentiation. In addition, he beautifully showed the cross-talk between ADAM and MMP in regulating FGFR2 signaling and osteogenesis.

Our long-term objectives are to translate knowledge obtained in laboratory mouse models, into clinical outcomes through the creation of novel diagnostic tools or new small molecules modulators with therapeutic value in the corresponding human disease. We are currently focusing on three major human diseases known to have clear genetic component: infectious diseases, cancer, and the birth defect spina bifida. Our genetic platform is based on the use of genetically diverse mouse inbred strains, recombinant congenic strains, and experimentally induced mutagenized mouse stocks (ENU mutants). Our research on infectious diseases focuses on pathogens that invade and replicate inside host cells, and that use this strategy to evade the immune system and other normal host defenses. These pathogens include (cerebral malaria). In these research programs, we have cloned major genes that regulate response to infections, and in the case of complex genetic control, we have isolated single gene effects in unique recombinant or mutant mouse strains. In the area of mycobacteria, we have shown that a transporter of metal ions (such as iron and manganese), which is expressed at the membrane of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes formed in macrophages, is critical to restrict intracellular replication of these microbes. The protein (known as Nramp1 or Slc11a1) acts as a biological chelator to remove from the phagosomal space metal ions that are required for metabolic activity and survival of the pathogen. In mice, Nramp1 mutations cause susceptibility to a number of infections including Mycobacteria, but also other pathogens such as . In humans, it was demonstrated that sequence polymorphisms at NRAMP1 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy in areas of endemic disease. We are currently studying the mechanism of transport of Nramp1 and are searching for bacterial proteins and biochemical pathways that activity is dependent on Nramp1 metal ions substrates, and that may be targeted for drug discovery. , we have shown that mouse strains susceptible to this infection carry mutations in a protein known as Naip5/Birc1e. This cytoplasmic protein forms part of an ancient antigen-recognition system known as the NLR family, which includes both cell surface and intracellular receptors that recognize so-called PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) in a manner distinct from that of the normal immune system. Upon infection of these cells, Naip5/Birc1e is essential for early intracellular sensing of products by macrophages. Sensing of bacterial products by Naip5/Birc1e results in stimulation of a multiprotein complex known as the inflammasome that amplifies the molecular signal. Activation of this pathway antagonizes the virulence determinants that allow to otherwise survive inside the phagosome. We have also observed that two members of the IRF transcription factors family (namely IRF1 and IRF8) play an important role in macrophage defenses against , acting either downstream or in parallel of Naip5/Birc1e signaling. We are currently using transcript profiling with microarrays and a proteomic approach to identify additional genes and proteins which expression and or phosphorylation status is modulated by Naip5/Birc1e signaling in response to Tuberculosis remains one of the major threats to global health, and there is an acknowledged role for genetic factors in disease susceptibility. In a mouse model of aerosol infection with , we have shown that a locus on chromosome 7 is partly responsible for the complex genetic control of the inter-strain difference in susceptibility between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. We have created special mouse strains in which the resistance-associated copy of chromosome 9 has been isolated on a genetically susceptible background. These strains are being used to characterize the molecular basis of the effect and to ultimately clone the gene responsible. Studying the mouse strain BXH2 in the same infection model, we have shown that mutations in the myeloid-specific transcription factor known as Icsbp/IRF8 completely impair natural defenses against TB, with the animals dying rapidly of fulminant infection. Deficiency in Icsbp/IRF8 also impairs innate and acquired immunity to a number of other infections, including typhoid and malaria. We are presently using genome wide approaches such as chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling arrays (ChIP on chip), and transcript profiling in macrophages from mutant animals to identify and validate transcriptional targets of IRF1 and IRF8. Such genes constitute good candidates for possible alterations in humans suffering from innate susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. , has a complex life cycle that involves both an insect vector and a mammalian host. In the latter, various forms of the Plasmodium parasites replicate in different cell types including hepatocytes, and erythrocytes where it induces a severe anemia. The subsequent accumulation of parasitized erythrocytes in brain capillaries is responsible for the severe and lethal cerebral pathology. Using as a model for blood-stage replication of the parasite, we have mapped a number of loci that affect replication of the pathogen inside red cells. Furthermore, have shown that deficiency in the erythrocyte form of pyruvate kinase protects mice against malaria. More recently, we have also shown that homozygocity or heterozygosity for mutant PKLR alleles protects human erythrocytes against infection with . We have also shown that a mutation in the Vnn3 gene (that codes for a pantetheinase) causes susceptibility to blood-stage malaria. The pantetheinase product cysteamine is essential for early response to the parasite, and we can protect otherwise susceptible mice against malaria by pre-treating them with cysteamine. We are currently testing the clinical potential of cysteamine (used alone or in combination with artemisinin) as a novel prophylactic treatment against malaria in humans. infection in humans is cerebral malaria (CM). This pathology is invariably lethal, and is caused by the accumulation of parasitized erythrocytes in the microvasculature, including the blood brain barrier. This accumulation causes a strong, host-driven, inflammatory response in situ that exacerbates pathology, and ultimately causes come and death. In mouse, CM can be induced by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. We have mapped a novel locus on chromosome 19 (berr4) that controls susceptibility to CM in mouse strains BALB/c (resistant) and C57BL/6J (susceptible). We are currently studying the mechanism by which Berr5 exert its protective effect. We have also initiated a large genomic screen in ENU-mutagenized mice to identify novel genes and pathways involved in susceptibility to CM, in particular genes and proteins that cause the massive and lethal inflammation in P. berghei infected animals. , we have reported that susceptibility to infection in the A/J mouse strain is caused by a mutation in the complement component C5a. These studies showed that C5a is not only required for the destruction of C. albicans by mononuclear phagocytes, but have established that C5a acts as a potent early chemotactic factor to recruit neutrophils, and monocytes at the site of the primary infection. Recently, we have identified several inbred strains of mice that have normal C5a function, but yet are susceptible to C. albicans infection, and vice versa. The genetic determinants responsible for this susceptibility are currently being mapped out. Our laboratory has worked for many years on the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in tumor cells, as caused by members of the P-glcoprotein (MDR) and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) family. More recently, we have studied resistance to two groups of drugs that are used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, namely the nuceloside analog arabinocytosine (cytarabine), and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Valcade). We are currently studying the mechanism by which Bortezomib induces cell death via formation of stress granules, and activation of programmed cell death, and how Bortezomib resistant cell lines developed in our laboratory can survive these effects of the drug. More recently, we have turned our attention to genetic determinants involved in pre-disposition to cancer. In this new project, we have used chemical carcinogenesis with azoxymethane (AOM) to induce colorectal tumors in mice. We have screened several inbred strains of mice for differences in susceptibility to colorectal cancer induced by AOM, measured by the type, number and size of lesions detected in the colon. In this assay, A/J mice are susceptible while C57BL/6J mice are highly resistant. Using a unique set of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic mouse lines, we have determined that the genetic basis for this difference in susceptibility is caused by a single major locus, that we have named Ccs3. The locus maps on chromosome 3, and the minimal genetic and physical interval for this region contains an estimated ~50 genes. These genes are currently being investigated for their pattern of tissue and cell-specific expression, and for the presence of mutations in either normal tissues or in DNA from tumors emerging in susceptible animals. We are also interrogating human primary tumor samples for alterations in human homologs of the mouse genes present in the Ccs3 interval. Finally, we have developed a model of inflammation-induced colorectal cancer, induced by dextran sulfate and AOM. We are investigating the genetic basis of differential susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to colorectal tumors induced by this treatment. Neural tube defects (NTD) such as spina bifida are very common in humans, and rank second only to cardiac defects in inborn errors. Our laboratory has been studying two mouse models of NTD, namely the splotch mouse, and more recently the looptail (Lp) mouse. Mice homozygote for the Lp mutation suffer from a very severe form of neural tube defect called craniorachischisis. This condition is lethal in utero. Using a positional cloning approach, we found that the Lp defect is caused by mutations in the membrane protein Vangl2. This protein is a mammalian homolog of the fly /strabismus, a gene known to be involved in regulating the development of certain structures in the fly, being part of a pathway known as the PCP pathway, standing for planar cell polarity. Flies with mutations in this pathway have defect in the organization of several appendages and structures (wings, eyes), which is caused by an inability of epithelial cells to properly organize in the planar polarity field. This pathway is highly conserved from flies to humans, and in mammals this pathway is also involved in certain types of morphogenic movements during embryogenesis known as convergent extension; Again, this pathway involves the dynamic rearrangement and migration of epithelial cells to form primordial structures, including the neural tube, the heart, the kidney and others. genes, Vangl1 and Vangl2 that encode for highly similar membrane proteins. We recently detected mutations in the human VANGL1 gene in familial and sporadic cases of spina bifida. We have also recently determined that VANGL1 and VANGL2 genetically interact in the regulation of neurogenesis and in the appearance of neural tube defects in mice. These exciting findings suggest that the VANGL family may play a critical role in the etiology of this malformation. We are currently investigating large number of clinical cases to determine the frequency of such mutations, and are exploring the molecular basis for the loss of function in these patients. This is being investigated in mouse models, but also in zebra fish, where the human gene can correct the neural tube defect detected in fish embryos showing a defect in the corresponding fish homolog. Biochemically, we are investigating the multiprotein complex formed by Vangl proteins at the membrane and that is responsible for providing polarity information to the cells, and how alterations in this complex may cause spina bifida in humans.", "tag": "aspirant"},

FLCN was identified as an AMPK binding partner, and we demonstrated that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of AMPK. Loss of FLCN constitutively activated AMPK, resulting in PGC-1\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, increased ROS production, which induced HIF transcriptional activity and drove Warburg metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming stimulated cellular bioenergetics and conferred a HIF-dependent tumorigenic advantage in FLCN-negative cancer cells. Moreover, using Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, we showed that loss of FLCN results in constitutive AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy, inhibition of apoptosis, enhanced cellular bioenergetics, and resistance to energy-depleting stresses including oxidative stress, heat, anoxia, and serum deprivation. We further showed that AMPK activation conferred by FLCN loss is independent of the cellular energy state suggesting that FLCN controls the AMPK energy sensing ability. Together, our data suggest that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of AMPK signaling that acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AMPK function. We are now studying the mechanism of FLCN inhibition with respect to AMPK sensing activity as well as the effect of FLCN loss and AMPK activation in tumor progression in various human cancers. 2) Role of ESCRT component HD-PTP/PTPN23 in cancer - Components of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) have long been proposed to act as tumor suppressors. PTPN23 or HD-PTP, an ESCRT associated protein, is located on 3p21.3, a region frequently deleted in many human malignancies. Previously, we have demonstrated that HD-PTP is a catalytically inactive PTP due to an evolutionary conserved divergence in its phosphatase domain. Using a mouse model we showed that HD-PTP is expressed in all epithelial tissues and that homozygous deletion of Ptpn23 is embryonic lethal at day 9.5. We are now characterizing various cancer phenotypes in this mouse model to elucidate the function of HD-PTP in tumorigenesis. We are also studying the effect of HD-PTP depletion on cell surface receptor trafficking, by elucidating the molecular determinants of endocytosed receptors targeting for recycling or lysosomal delivery such as receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination. ESCRT machinery is responsible for lysosomal targeting of ubiquitinated receptors, which leads to their signal abrogation. Therefore, depletion of ESCRT components is likely to result in enhanced recycling and downstream signalling of receptors escaping degradation, potentially leading to enhanced tumor initiation and progression.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Hall (2004) The second demographic traansition, new household forms and the urban population of France during the 1990s Ray Hall and Philip Ogden are currently working collaboratively on a project that researches population change in European Cities. They are particularly interested in investigating household change and the growth of living alone and non-traditional household forms. They have just received a small grant from the Volkswagen Foundation as part of a programme entitled 'socio-spatial consequences of demographic change for East Central European cities'. For this project they are working with colleagues from Leipzig, Poland and the Czech Republic. They will be adding a comparative dimension using examples from British and French cities. Changes in the numbers and types of household have been quite remarkable over the last two or three decades. This project (with Dr Ray Hall at QM and funded by the ESRC, EU and British Academy) is concerned with the UK, France and other European countries, particularly with the rise of one-person households. It is also interested in associated patterns of migration at both national and regional (especially urban) scales. Principal sources include censuses, as well as longitudinal data from the Longitudinal Study (England and Wales) and the Echantillon D\u00e9mographique Permanent (France). The research also embraces qualitative methodology. A Nuffield Foundation grant to Philip Ogden concentrates upon recent household changes in leading British and French cities. A further phase of the project (with Ray Hall and Stefan Buzhar at QM and European partners in Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Spain and Slovakia) is looking particularly at household changes and reurbanisation. The department at Queen Mary has long had an interest in population and migration trends in France and other parts of Europe. Recent years have seen a number of publications, reports and PhD theses produced in this field, and there is much scope for further work in a broadly European context in the department. Work in France has been concerned with general immigration trends in the l980s and 1990s and their political consequences; also with the evolution of French government policy throughout the twentieth century. A research network was established in 1998, funded by the British Council and the Minist\u00e8re des Affaires Etrang\u00e8res (Paris), bringing together researchers from the Population Dynamics and Health Research Group at QM (Ogden, Hall, Curtis) and from the Universities of Paris, Lille, Lyons and Toulouse. The principal theme of collaborative research is household and population change in British and French cities, subsequently expanded to other European countries (see above). This project formed part of the department's broad and long-standing interests in migration trends in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe. The present project is set within the context of immigration to France since the Second World War, which has become an issue of major social, economic and political importance. By the 1980s the population of foreign nationality numbered some four millions and was strongly concentrated geographically and in particular sectors of the economy. Although much research, comment and controversy have focused on the population of North African origin, immigrants in fact come from a wide variety of sources both within and outside Europe. This project looked at a highly distinctive group - migrants from the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe - who, because of their French nationality (the islands are d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer) and the organized nature of their migration, share only in part the socio-economic characteristics of the foreign immigrant population. Quantitatively, they are by no means negligible: the 1999 census indicated that over 400,000 people originated from the d\u00e9partements et territoires d'outre-mer (of whom two-thirds were from the Caribbean) and they have been one of the fastest-growing migrant groups, escaping the immigration controls on foreign nationals imposed during the 1970s and 1980s. This project focused on the process of migration and the role of governmental and private agencies in shaping and implementing migration policy; and on patterns of residence and employment amongst Afro-Caribbean migrants, with particular reference to Paris and to the health service. The latter phase of the project investigated return migration to the Caribbean in the context of changing French government policy in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, the London Docklands experienced change of revolutionary proportions. The previous two decades had seen the gradual erosion of both port activities and the associated manufacturing and service industries. The population was in decline, unemployment high and social conditions - in an area that has rarely known prosperity - rapidly deteriorating. A number of schemes for urban regeneration had been mooted but it is particularly with the activity of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) from 1981 to 1998 that the dramatic change in the pace and nature of development is associated. Though the landscape of Docklands has evolved rapidly, with massive office and housing schemes being completed at breakneck speed, the process of change - and the evaluation of 'success' or 'failure' - is highly contentious. Certainly, there is an urgent need for academic research on the area, as it has assumed both national and international prominence. Research at QM during the 1990saimed to elucidate one aspect of the development process: the arrival and nature of new residents. Funding was obtained in cooperation with colleagues in Paris and Brussels, since there is much to be learnt about the London experience in the light of wider changes in other European cities. The project is thus placed within the context of changes in the financial and economic structure of the city, and their consequences for 'gentrification'. The aim was to investigate the residential and other demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the new population. Among questions of particular interest to us were the geographical origins of the population, their recent mobility history, their family status, number of children, occupation, income, place of work and pattern both of travel to work and of international travel as part of work. Three sorts of source materials were used: an extensive questionnaire survey in the westernmost part of the LDDC area - Wapping and Limehouse - among residents in properties converted or built since 1981; a variety of material about the character of new residential building in the area, obtained through developers, architects and estate agents; and, as a base against which to compare our results, the small-area data from the censuses of population. Results confirmed some and rejected other aspects of the stereotypical view of the new residential population. Qualitative research has been carried out in the area as part of the ESRC-funded project on household change noted above.

Natural and synthetic analogs of these substances are used extensively to control a broad spectrum of human diseases including cancer. The effects of each hormone depend primarily on a protein referred to as a receptor. The study of these receptors is important to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular response to these inducers. This is a group of novel steroid hormone-like receptors for which the ligands remain unknown. Our research program in this area is aimed at identifying novel hormones and the function of their receptors during development, homeostasis and in cancer cells. The research endeavors of my laboratory in this area are directed toward understanding the molecular basis of vitamin A action. We are generating genetically altered mouse strains to study the role of retinoid receptors in cancer progression. These studies should improve our basic knowledge of retinoid physiology and lead to a better understanding of the role of retinoids in suppressing the development of neoplastic cells. Perhaps one of the most exciting long-term hopes in breast cancer treatment is that a better understanding of the role of hormones in mammary differentiation, such as that which occurs during mammary gland development and potentially protects against breast cancer, will lead to new effective strategies in breast cancer prevention and treatment. Thus, our research is directed at improving our knowledge of the roles of estradiol, an ovarian hormone implicated in the growth and proliferation of normal and abnormal mammary cells. Using approaches, our current objectives are to study the signaling pathways implicated in the activation of its two receptors (alpha and beta) during mammary gland development. It is hoped that our molecular and genetic analysis of orphan nuclear receptors, retinoid action and estrogen receptors will lead to an increase in our understanding of these hormone-based systems which, in turn, will help develop more efficient therapy for treatment of cancer.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Our work in the past few years has uncovered an important regulator of invasive cell growth, the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. In normal cells, Met acts to relay signals from the cell surface that promote tissue organisation. However when these pathways are altered in cancer cells, this acts to enhance cell invasion the first step of metastasis. Our aims are to identify what signal transduction pathways are important for the development of human cancers and how these can be targeted with drug therapies. This is a complex question that requires a full understanding of how signals are integrated in normal cells and how these signals become altered in tumor cells, in the context of other genetic alterations. My lab has focused on and will continue to address these questions using the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and oncogene as a model. We will focus on signals required for anchorage independent growth, morphological cell transformation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, cell invasion and tumorigenesis. Deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases in human cancers can occur through positive activation of the receptor or through the loss of negative regulatory controls. We have identified that Cbl a ubiquitin ligase acts as a negative regulatory signal for the Met receptor. We will establish the molecular mechanism through which Cbl negatively regulates the Met receptor and establish if this is a mechanism for receptor deregulation in human cancers. We will exploit the use of substrate specific variants of the Met receptor to dissect signaling pathways essential for tumor induction and metastasis and will dissect signals that promote tumor angiogenesis. Tight control of cell proliferation and morphogenesis is required to ensure normal tissue patterning and prevent cancer. Our objectives are to understand how Gab family docking proteins modulate epithelial morphogenesis by addressing; i) which Gab1 dependent signals are required for morphogenesis, by assessing known Gab1 associated proteins and Gab1 associated proteins identifid by tandem mass spectroscopy, ii) the molecular basis through which the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for morphogenesis. We will continue to identify key regulators of epithelial cell motility and invasion. We will establish the molecular basis through which the Crk adapter protein induces epithelial cell migration using a proteomic approach to identify Crk associated proteins and using cell biology and mouse models for cell invasion. A microarray approach will be used to identify genes associated with breast cancer progression and cell biology and animal models will be used to understand the function of such genes.", "tag": "aspirant"},

The essential genetic and cellular events involved in transformation of these EBV-infected premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelium are under investigation using state-of-start molecular and cellular platforms. The functional interactions of EBV-encoded oncogenes and signaling events driving the malignant transformation of premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial cells are key directions of investigation. The oncogenic potential of EBV genes and their effects on cell signaling mechanisms in infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells leading to deregulation of cell growth, escape from senescence, resistance to apoptosis, invasive properties and other malignant properties are under investigation. NPC is closely association with EBV infection. EBV infection of primary B cells drives their transformation into proliferative lymphoblastoid cell lines. In contrast, EBV infection of primary nasopharyngeal epithelial cells induce growth arrest. EBV infection of normal pharyngeal epithelial cells are believed to be lytic in nature contributing to the generation of infectious EBV for transmission in saliva. In NPC cells, EBV infection is latent in nature. The establishment of latent infection in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells may represent an early and essential step in NPC pathogenesis. Using the immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell models and new EBV+ve NPC cell lines established in our laboratory, we are defining the key events involved in the establishment of latent EBV infection in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.

It has also investigated the ways in which the English East India Company used a variety of forms of writing ( , 2007) to construct a global trading network and territorial empire in India from 1600 to 1800. This was the same broad timespan for my attempt to write an introduction to global history through biography in (2008). I am currently undertaking a Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship (2015-2017) on the relationship between speech and slavery in the Caribbean. This work investigates how different forms of talk \u2013 such as evidence giving in court, discussions of the plants that grew on the islands, and communications with the world of gods and spirits \u2013 demonstrate the complexities of the power relations of slavery and empire. One element of this work was presented in the session on Historical and Cultural Geographies of Story and Storytelling at the RGS-IBG conference in Exeter in September 2015. It is a paper called \u2018We cannot but speak the thing, which we have seen and heard: believing stories in Caribbean slave societies\u2019. Hear it here: I teach modules in human geography at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. In all of my teaching I aim to introduce students to key concepts through using a wide range of examples (often from my own research), and getting students to analyse and understand original materials for themselves. I have also written the textbooks for my own courses, so that students have clear guidance on what I am looking for and a range of resources to bring to the classroom. I teach parts of human geography that are often new to students arriving at university, so it is important to make them accessible. In the second year I teach the cultural geography part of GEG5110 . Here students learn about the meanings of spaces, places and landscapes and, for their coursework, are asked to choose a picture of a landscape to interpret for themselves. In the third year I teach a module (GEG6105 \u2013and also on visits to London museums. Here students are taught how to use historical sources, and how to write their own historical accounts of subjects such as slavery, piracy and oceanic voyaging.

This on-going research project considers the relationships between talk, text and (un)freedom in the slave societies of the Caribbean. Focusing on law, natural history, religion and politics, as well as the movements for abolition and emancipation, this project attends not to what was said in the past but to the cultural practices of talk themselves. These are particular, more or less rule-bound, ways of speaking such as the sermon, the botanical conversation, the giving of evidence, gossip or debating. In each case I examine the social and spatial relationships that were involved in and produced through these practices from the small scale geographies of the spaces where talk went on (in courtrooms, plantations gardens and streets) to the trans-Atlantic networks that these modes of speech were part of. Studying speech provides an empirical and theoretical basis for moving away from the dominant textual model of representation of people and places towards one based on the idea of an on-going, situated, power-laden and agonistic \u2018conversation\u2019 with many participants using text and talk in different ways.

We use the tools of molecular and cell biology to study problems in this field. The long-term research goals focus on understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of mRNA half-lives and how they affect cell growth and differentiation. mRNA stability influences gene expression in virtually all organisms, from bacteria to mammals. In mammalian cells, the abundance of a particular mRNA can fluctuate dramatically due to a change in mRNA half-life, without any change in transcription. The processes that regulate mRNA half-lives can thus affect how a cell grows, differentiates and responds to its environment. Understanding these processes requires a combination of different approaches; molecular biology and biochemistry techniques will help to understand the molecular mechanisms by which mRNA stability and degradation are regulated during cell division and differentiation and the cell biological technology will help to establish the connection between them. Towards these goals, we are using and developing methods to facilitate the identification and the characterization of factors involved in the stabilization as well as in the degradation of mRNAs in mammalian cells. Although these two phenomena are well-studied separately, very little is known about how they are integrated inside the cell. We do not know the factors that bridge and thus allow cross talk between the two processes. Since many cancer cells exhibit changes in mRNA half-lives, a precise balance between the two processes is needed to preserve cell integrity. Therefore, it is important to define the link between mRNA stabilization and degradation, and to establish how both are regulated inside the cell. Making this connection will help to clarify how and why many cancers start and will provide new targets for future therapy.", "tag": "aspirant"},

We combine a vast array of molecular biology and functional genomic approaches together with tissue culture and mouse models to investigate how alterations in DNA repair and DNA damage responses contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. We study how defects in DNA repair can contribute to tumor initiation and how certain cancer cells become dependent on specific DNA repair pathways. It is generally accepted that defects in DNA repair, whether transient or permanent, contribute to tumor development and progression. Yet, to replicate their DNA and proliferate, cancer cells need DNA repair mechanisms, perhaps even more so than normal cells. Moreover, efficient DNA repair mechanisms can enable cancer cells to resist radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We are entering a new era of cancer research in which patients will be stratified for appropriate therapy on the basis of their DNA repair status, rather than on the tissue of origin, and where combination treatments will include DNA repair inhibitors. The goal of our work is to use the acquired knowledge to exacerbate the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiotherapy and specific chemotherapeutic treatments. In particular, we investigate the molecular and cellular functions of the Cut homeobox 1 (CUX1) gene, a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene that is often amplified and overexpressed in advanced cancer. We study which molecular functions of CUX1 protect against cancer and which molecular functions are associated with tumour progression. CUX1 codes for several protein isoforms. Some CUX1 isoforms function as transcriptional activators or repressors, depending on promoter context. Transcriptional activities of CUX1 promote cell cycle progression, DNA replication and DNA damage responses. Another CUX1 isoform which is very abundant functions as an accessory factor in DNA repair and stimulates the efficiency of base excision repair. While this activity in DNA repair protects normal cells against DNA damage and mutations, increased expression of this isoform in cancer cells contributes to their resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In contrast, knockdown of CUX1 expression sensitizes cancer cells to treatments. We are in the process of identifying drugs that inhibit the DNA repair functions of CUX1 with the aim of sensitizing cancer cells to treatments. Sansregret, L., J. Livingstone, C. Vadnais, N.

Though archival sources and interviews the project examined the changing nature of the border over time, its effects on everyday life, the distinctive regional impacts of these effects, the symbolic, material and practised dimensions of the border, and the senses of local, regional, national and cross-border collective identities and differences, interconnections and divisions, through the accounts of those most directly affected by the border. The research has been published as journal papers and in: The programme of research carried out during this Research Fellowship set out to examine the understandings of human relatedness being expressed through and shaped by contemporary popular and scientific explorations of personal and collective origins and ancestry.

The human immune system is generally divided into two broad categories, the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system. Adaptive immunity relies on a very large repertoire of clonally distributed antigen receptors displayed on lymphocytes and secreted antibodies that have the ability to recognize almost any foreign molecule. Conversely, innate immunity depends on a limited set of germ-line encoded receptors, which recognize distinct molecular patterns on pathogen surfaces. These receptors are strategically expressed on cells that are likely to encounter antigen early in an infection, including cells of the respiratory tract, epithelial cells of the gut and skin, and professional antigen presenting cells. As a result, the innate immune response generally precedes the adaptive immune response. Specifically, our lab studies components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal tranduction pathway, including the TLR receptors themselves and members of the Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) family using X-ray crystallography and other biophysical techniques. Using structural analysis, we would like to dissect the molecular basis for specificity of TLR-ligand interactions and the mechanisms by which the IRAKs are regulated.

My research focuses on the genetic regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in a variety of developmental processes. Currently, my research programmes cover broad areas of: gene regulation in development, molecular control of neural crest differentiation, genetic bases and mutant mouse models of human diseases, neural stem cells. Our work has concentrated on the development of the nervous system and the neural crest. We have a long standing interest in studying the regulation of homeobox gene expression and the complex network of interactions between homeobox genes and other transcription factors which lead to the proper development of the hindbrain, craniofacial and inner ear structures. We have established a strong team specialised in the transgenic mice approach to study gene regulation at various levels of the control cascade. We used bacterial lacZ gene as a reporter to analyse genomic regions that are important for spatial and temporal regulation of Hox gene expression. Using these spatially specific enhancer elements to direct the expression of a homeobox gene Hoxb3 in transgenic mice, we have generated different strains of gain-of-function mutant mice. By gene targeting technology, we generated a Hoxb3 null mutant and other specific deletion mutants in transgenic mice. With these varieties of mutant Hoxb3 alleles we are investigating the molecular and genetic interactions of various homeobox genes. Our recent work on the molecular control of neural crest differentiation has focused on a transcription factor gene Sox10, which is expressed in several distinct neural crest derived cell lineages including the enteric nervous system, glia of the central and peripheral nervous system, and melanocytes. By cell transfection and in vivo transgenic mice analyses, we are studying the effect of specific mutations on the function of the Sox10 protein. Using cell and animal models, we also examine the signalling mechanisms involving Sox10 and its interacting partners during neural crest differentiation. Our interest in mammalian development has led us to explore the molecular basis of human diseases by creating and examining transgenic animal models.

(1999) 0.5 million-year pollen records from southern Europe. My research centres on understanding the response of vegetation to variations in climatic forcing on orbital and millennial timescales. I have generated some of the longest reference pollen records from terrestrial and marine sequences. An underlying theme is the linking of terrestrial, marine and ice-core records to assess how land events relate to atmospheric and ocean changes. Recent research focuses on past interglacials, which are providing a basis for comparison with the present interglacial and its future evolution. This work has provided insights into the: (i) response characteristic of European vegetation to orbital and millennial climate changes; (ii) nature and distribution of glacial tree refugia; (iii) climatic signature of critical intervals in human evolution; (iv) occurrence and duration of interglacials and implications for the natural length of our current interglacial.

The formation of the renal and genital systems during embryonic development involves complex molecular and cellular events. A failure to perform these cellular functions is responsible for the high frequency of urogenital malformations found in newborn (about 1:500). Interestingly, the genes involved in key steps of embryonic development are often also involved in tumor formation later on. We are interested in the molecular networks regulating processes such as cell lineage specification, epithelialization and epithelial integrity, tubular extension, apoptotic morphogenesis and proliferation control. We tackle these important questions using a combination of mouse genetics, tissue and cell culture as well as molecular and biochemical assays. A number of transcription factors have been involved in the formation of the urogenital system. We are focusing on the transcriptional network controlled by Gata3, Pax2 and Pax8 at different steps of UGS development. We have previously shown the role of Pax genes in nephric lineage specification, branching morphogenesis and nephron differentiation. We also demonstrated the requirement for Gata3 in proliferation control, duct elongation and guidance as well as tubular homeostasis. We are pursuing these studies to identify the key molecules mediating these cellular functions downstream of Pax and Gata factors. We have recently described the process by which the ureter connects to the bladder during embryonic development (distal ureter maturation). Interestingly, this process involves the elimination of a cell population by programmed cell death. We further identified LAR-family receptor protein phosphatases (PTPRF and PTPRS) as necessary for this process. We are currently pursuing the characterization of the role of LAR-family phosphatases in apoptosis-mediated morphogenesis. Over the years, it has become clear that several genes required for normal embryonic development are also involved in tumor formation after birth. Another ongoing interest of the lab is to understand the contribution of Pax and Gata transcription factors and their transcriptional targets in urogenital tissue neoplasia.

In addition to their role as intercellular adhesion molecules, these proteins also function as negative immune regulators in T and B lymphocytes as well as NK cells, platelets and neutrophils. In addition, these cell surface glycoproteins function as receptors for mouse hepatitis viruses and the human CEACAM1 is the receptor for Neisseria bacteria. Our goal is to understand how CEACAM1 transmits negative regulatory signals to different cell types and the mechanisms by which these proteins perform their function. We are consistently using molecular and cell biology approaches, as well as in vivo genetic manipulation to produce either Ceacam1 gene knockout mice or transgenic mice overexpressing either wild-type or mutant versions of the protein. We are currently involved in the characterization of the associated phenotypes in these animals to understand the functions in an in vivo setting. Role of CEACAM1 proteins in tumor formation and progression: We have shown that CEACAM1 proteins, normally expressed in epithelial cells, are down-regulated early in the process of epithelial tumor development. By reintroducing the proteins in colon tumor cells having lost their expression, we have shown that these cells no longer behave like tumor cells. The downregulation of CEACAM1 protein expression is one of the major genetic changes associated with colon, liver, endometrial, prostate and breast cancers. We have shown that maintenance of the negative proliferation signals in colonic cells depends on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 and its association to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. On the other hand, CEACAM1 expression is upregulated in angiogenic situations. We are currently assessing how the up-regulation of CEACAM1 expression in endothelial cells results in tumor progression in the later phases of cancer development. We are also deciphering the role of the CEACAM1 protein in colon cancer metastasis using in vivo models. Our focus is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the modulation of the CEACAM1 expression and how this can translate into more effective therapies for cancer patients. Liver metastasis is the predominant cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality in developed countries. CEACAM1 is a cell adhesion molecule with reduced expression in early phases of CRC development and thus functions as a tumor growth inhibitor. However, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in metastatic colon cancer, suggesting a bimodal role in CRC progression. To investigate the role of this protein in the host metastatic environment, livers was also diminished. Bone Marrow-Derived Cell recruitment, attenuation of immune infiltrates and diminished CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 chemokine production participated in the reduced metastatic livers and adoptive transfer of myeloid-derived suppressor cells confirmed the involvement of these immune cells in reduction of liver metastasis.

Up to five different cytoplasmic IF proteins can be expressed in adult neurons and we study four of these, namely, peripherin and the neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins, NFL, NFM and NFH. Overexpression of either of these neuronal IF proteins in transgenic mice can have an adverse effect on defined populations of neurons, such as motor neurons, giving rise to a neurodegenerative disease resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The neurotoxicity of these overexpressed IF proteins appears to at least partly be due to their propensity to form aggregates. We are attempting to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms underlying these ALS-like diseases by studying pertinent signal transduction pathways in transgenic mice or in primary neuronal cultures derived from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mouse embryos. The primary DRG cultures contain two major cell types: sensory neurons and Schwann cells, which are the glial cells that form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. In addition to neuronal studies involving IFs, we use these cultures to study myelination, which can be induced by adding ascorbate to the culture medium. We are particularly interested in the signal transduction pathways that are activated in myelinating Schwann cells and have recently implicated p38, a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which appears to exert its effect at the level of the actin cytoskeleton. The Schwann cells in DRG cultures can be selectively removed using antimitotic agents and the remaining sensory neurons can be seeded with oligodendrocytes in order to study myelination by glial cells derived from the central nervous system.", "tag": "aspirant"},

In connection to these two major areas of research, our interests also extend to other general aspects of molecular cell biology, including transcriptional regulation, post-translational protein modifications, cell signaling and non-coding RNAs. In our study of human T-cell leukemia virus type I oncoprotein Tax, we identified a cellular protein named MAD1, a key component of the mitotic checkpoint (Jin et al., 1998). We also characterized another centrosomal target of Tax protein that might contribute to the development of aneuploidy in leukemic cells (Ching et al., 2006). Our investigations on Epstein-Barr virus revealed a new mechanism in which a viral microRNA targets a cellular proapoptotic protein to promote the survival of tumour cells (Choy et al., 2008). We also found that the cytoplasmic virus sensor RIG-I needs a double-stranded RNA-binding protein partner called PACT to initiate and sustain innate antiviral response (Kok et al., 2011). Our findings have revealed novel disease mechanisms, in the next stage we will endeavor to translate them into new targets and strategies in the prevention and precision treatment of human diseases.

He earned his PhD degree from the University of California, Los Angeles. Thereafter, Prof. Huang received his postdoctoral training in mouse genetics at National Cancer Institute, NIH in the USA. During this period, Prof. Huang was the first to report that the two major intracellular transportation systems of mammalian cells, the microtubule- and actin-filament-based system directly interact with each other through their motor proteins, kinesin and myosin. He established his own laboratory at the University of Hong Kong. Prof. Huang is now an endowed professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences, the University of Hong Kong. : My major research interest is in the mechanism of intracellular transportation and its roles in development, cellular functions and diseases. Within the cell, a variety of cellular components are moved to specific sites at specific times. The intracellular transportation processes are essential not only for housekeeping purpose but also for specialized cellular functions, such as the transport of synaptic vesicles. Intracellular transportation is carried out over two major cellular networks, the microtubule and actin networks. Micro-tubule motors include the kinesin and dynein families of proteins while actin motors are the myosin family of proteins. Current research suggests that the micro-tubule network is used for transport over long distances while the actin network is used for short-range delivery in animal cells. Disruption of these processes result in genetic diseases. For example, mutation in myosin-VA results in human Griscelli disease characterized by pigment dilution, immunodeficiency, neurological defect and cognitive disorder. Mutations in other motor molecules result in many other diseases such as heart diseases and deafness. My previous work demonstrated that myosin-VA can interact directly with the ubiquitously expressed kinesin, implying that the two transportation systems are at least partially coordinated through their motor molecules. The major interest of my group is to use transgenic and knockout mice to study the functions of kinesins in chondrocytes, neurons, and other cell types. Another area of interest in the lab is to investigate the molecular and structural basis of cargo-binding by kinesins. Synthetic Biology refers to the design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world; and the re-design and fabrication of existing biological systems for useful purpose. My laboratory is aiming to design and fabricate artificial biological parts, devices and circuits to control biological pattern formation, to attack cancer cells, and to prevent infectious diseases.

(2007) \u2018Keeping London working: global cities, the British state, and London\u2019s new migrant division of labour\u2019, is taken in the 2nd year, introducing students to the key concerns of social geography. It centers upon an understanding of societies as products of uneven and always negotiated relationships of power. Drawing mainly but not exclusively on examples from the UK, it shows that social experience and identities are differentiated according to the social constructions of race and ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality and that, rather than simply varying across space, geography itself is central to the construction of social difference. The module aims to develop skills of critical social interpretation on the part of the students. Topics include: The geographies of race and ethnicity; Race, class and inequality in the global city; The purification of public space and the collapse of homeless space; The gendering of urban space; The geographies of sexuality; Rural homelessness and poverty. The module is assessed by 100% coursework, consisting of a 2000 word mock Wikipedia entry based upon a self-guided field walk in East London (50%), and 3000 word course work essay (50%). In feedback, students have praised the \"engaging and encouraging lecturer\", the interesting topics and the way in which \"seminars really helped me to engage with the key points\", and the \"different form of assessment, that allowed me to develop wider skills\" and to \"really engage with the literature and see its relevance to the real world\". to explore recent changes to north American and western European cities. The module can be taken in the second or third year. Using Los Angeles and Las Vegas as examples, and the notion of the 'post-metropolis' as an organising framework, students explore the key processes driving recent changes to our cities (globalisation and economic restructuring), the nature of those changes (rising inequality, and the emergence of new urban forms - from gentrification, to 'edge cities'), and responses to those changes (both the increased concern with urban security, and the increased 'theming' of urban environments). The module is organised around an innovative program of seminars (combining outline lectures, videos, and student presentations), and a 10 day residential field class in Los Angeles and Las Vegas that includes visits to a \u2018master planned community\u2019 in Orange County, California; community organisations in South-Central Los Angeles; group work in Korea Town, Venice Beach, Skid Row and Downtown Los Angeles; and ethnographic work on the Strip and in the themed casinos and hotels of Las Vegas. The module is assessed by 100% course work, with students completing a detailed Learning Log (reporting on their learning during the seminar course), a course work essay, and Field Diary (outlining their experiences in Los Angeles and Las Vegas). In feedback students found the module helped them to \"think about cities in new ways\", found the field trip \"brilliant\", \"eye opening\", and the course itself \"the best I have taken at university\". Framed by a concern with social justice, and alternatives to neoliberal welfare reform, over the past decade or so my research has focused on three key areas: 1) the politics of food banking, 2) the geographies of street homelessness, and 2) the role of migrants in London's low-wage economy (British Academy \u00a38,516) with Paul Cloke (University of Exeter), Andrew Williams (University of Cardiff) and Liev Cherry (Queen Mary University of London). The recent and rapid rise in the number of food banks in Britain has generated significant public and political debate. Framing their work in neo-liberal political economy and welfare, academic accounts of food banking have tended to be highly critical. Working with food bank providers and users, and examining both more familiar and a range of alternative approaches to food banking, this project explores food banks as a response to food insecurity and as potential sites of challenge to neoliberal political and ethical values and practices. , and related work with Paul Cloke (University of Exeter) (ESRC, \u00a3124,000) has sought to extend overly narrow and dystopic accounts of neoliberalism and urban revanchism by examining instead the various and complex experiences of and responses to street homelessness in contemporary Britain. Focusing on the potential and limits of post-secularism as a form of resistance and alternative to the neoliberalisation of the city and of welfare, our work has traced the changing geographies of homeless service provision, and homeless people\u2019s own understandings of voluntary service spaces and of the streets. The Global Cities at Work project, with QMUL colleagues Kavita Datta, Cathy McIlwaine and Jane Wills (ESRC \u00a3240,000) explored the role of labour market policy, subcontracting, and migration in shaping London's low-wage labour market and a distinctive Migrant Division of Labour in contemporary London, the diverse experiences of low-paid migrant workers themselves, and the politics attendant to such divisions.

He was appointed to an Associate Professorship in Biodiversity and Biogeography at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford in August 2010. He is also Fellow and Tutor in Physical Geography at Jesus College. The flora of some regions in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, like the Baviaanskloof above, possess an disparate mix of evolutionary histories and score highly on evolutionary biodiversity measures. , for a thesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to understand the evolution and maintenance of extinction-promoting traits in mammals and insects. In 2004 he joined the demonstrated for the first time that conservation decisions at a global scale must be data-driven if they are to be efficient, and cannot rely on knowledge of a few well-known species for guidance. the first demonstration that conservation efforts to protect the most species do not always protect the widest variety of genotypes or phenotypes. In 2007 Richard returned to Imperial College London to the Since 1999, Richard has been a contributor to a decade-long collaborative study to produce the first complete evolutionary tree of mammal species (above). This was published in 2007, and has been cited 280 times in 3 years. With the mammalian distribution dataset from UVA (and its later & better incarnations at the Richard has given plenary talks to the South African Society for Systematic Biology conference, and to the University of East Anglia, as well as research seminars in numerous UK and international universities. He has taught two courses in South Africa through the Darwin Initiative (University of Cape Town in 2007 and University of Johannesburg/ Pretoria in 2008), and has been invited for research visits at the University Of Cape Town (2008) and to an As a biologist, Richard is interested in the role of spatial processes in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Is there solid theory to describe how lineages of organisms evolve in space and time? Does existing theory predict the same spatial pattern of species richness and endemism we see around us? If we seek to manage biodiversity, we need to measure it - but how to do this is a long-standing problem in ecology. Does it matter that the units of biodiversity - species - are all the current product of both unique and shared evolutionary pressures and processes? Do we even need to overcome the \"Wallacean shortfall\": the difficult-to-know geography of which species is found where? Or can we simply abstract away all the differences in biology and ecology amongst species into different kinds and different amounts of ecosystem services? What do we mean by \"different ways of measuring diversity\"? As an example, by interfacing the distribution and phylogeny of mammals, we can determine two different Gondwanan legacies in Africa and South America: there are different kinds of mammal diversity on sister continents. Below, vertical extrusion is proportional to the number of mammal species today, and heat colour is proportional to their phylogenetic relatedness. African mammals took a long time to reach their current high richness, and are evolutionarily diverse. The mammals of South America, conversely, are characterised by explosive radiations leading to large families of close relatives (data from Davies In many ways, phylogenetic trees and geographical maps are very similar: both provide a means of conditioning our expectations of similarity amongst observations. Expected similarity in both cases is derived from some model of expected change as a function of the distance between observations. In phylogenetic terms this means specifying some model of evolutionary change over branch length, and in geographic terms specifying a model of expected decay in similarity over space. The fun starts when you have a set of observations that have both a phylogenetic and a spatial component - say, for example, most ecological datasets: how do we (and when should we) dissect the observed pattern into spatial, phylogenetic, and interaction components? The same is true with macroecological models that seek to explain the number of species across different regions: the phylogeny of species can both help explain and must be explained by the mechanism a model suggests. If we want to dissect these conflicting biological patterns, even at a basic level, we must solve the problem of overlapping influences of shared ancestry, shared location and biological interaction. As a conservationist Richard is interested in numerical and analytical strategies for the conservation of biodiversity. He uses techniques from evolutionary biology and ecology coupled with high-performance computing to dissect, analyze and advise the conservation process. Numerical analyses like this - usually called Strategic Conservation Planning - can help make maximally efficient on-the-ground conservation decisions (see his .). Numerical analyses can also help us understand what the conservation business today has become, what it does well (and not-so-well), and how it might have to change in an uncertain, pressured future. When we make choices about where and how to do conservation we make it more likely that some species and populations survive than others. Hopefully all these likelihoods are kept high, but we still induce differential risk. As a result we have a duty to make sure that the portfolio of biodiversity we favour has desirable properties. This could be as simple as having as many species in it as possible, or as complex as maximising functional or genetic diversity: again, it all comes down to how you measure diversity and how much difference it makes to resource allocation by conservation practitioners. To me, this means that conservation plans that aren't assessed against solutions to at least some form of spatial combinatoric problem with a defined optimality criterion simply aren't credible science, however politic they may be. As an example, the graph above shows the relative performance of some different types of global priority network from Grenyer, Orme . (2006). Performance measured with respect to capturing a, total species richness, b, rare species, and c, threatened species of birds, mammals and amphibians. Networks identified using an optimal complementarity approach based on birds alone (B), mammals alone (M), amphibians alone (A), or birds, mammals and amphibians combined (Cn, where n indicates the number of times each species is represented). Performance also shown for Biodiversity Hotspots (H), Endemic Bird Areas (E) and Global 200 Ecoregions (G), and for randomly selected sets of cells (100 replicates: median, black line; 95% confidence range, grey area). Richard teaches on both the 'Ecology of the Biosphere' course and the 'Quantitative Methods' course for the Preliminary Examination. He co-teaches the 'Biogeography, Biodiversity and Conservation' Option for the Final Honours School. He coordinates the 'Strategic Conservation Planning' module for the MSc in Biodiversity, Conservation and Management and contributes a GIS course to the 'Research Methods' module to all the MSc courses in SoGE. He also teaches on several field courses, including the Tenerife field courses for both the MSc course and Final Honours School in 2012. Richard is very interested in hearing from prospective graduate students with a biological, conservation or computational background (or all three!).

This feature represents the basis for its wide clinical use as a tumor marker. We have cloned genes coding for most of the family members in order to discern their normal functions and to determine the significance of their overexpression for cancer. We discovered that they function as intercellular adhesion molecules and suggested that, when inappropriately expressed at high levels in cells still capable of proliferation, they interfere with other cell surface interactions, leading to a distortion of tissue architecture and a to a block in terminal cellular differentiation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown that CEA expression can block the myogenic differentiation of rodent myoblasts and that this block can be released by peptides representing the adhesive domains of CEA. The cells are left in a quiescent state with continuous proliferation potential, and are particularly susceptible to the acquisition of further oncogenic lesions. It appears, therefore, that CEA-CEA interactions trigger a cellular response which contributes to malignancy. We have shown recently that other types of differentiation are also inhibited by CEA expression, including adipogenic, neuronal and, most importantly, human colonocyte differentiation. In the latter case, human colon cells transfected to overexpress CEA show a loss of cellular polarization and differentiation and a distortion of tissue architecture. In addition, a tissue architecture quality control mechanism known as anoikis, that kills cells not properly attached to their basement membranes by apoptosis, is inhibited. The molecular mechanism for these effects appears to involve a perturbation of integrin-substrate molecule interactions induced by CEA expression. This mechanism is currently under investigation.", "tag": "aspirant"},

She has a PhD (Human Geography) from the Open University, an MA in Society and Space from the University of Bristol and a BSc in Human Geography from the University of Reading. Prior to joining Oxford Beth lectured in Geography at Keele University and Queen Mary, University of London and held a post-doctoral fellowship at the Open University. Beth's work draws on a combination of political-economic geography, cultural geography and science studies to explore the social implications of scientific innovations in the areas of health, biomedicine and the environment. Employing a range of qualitative, ethnographic and archival methods, Beth seeks to understand the social, cultural and ethical processes through which humans and animals are made available as experimental subjects for biomedical research. She also contributes to the development of new theoretical and methodological approaches within Geography better able to capture the material and affective dimensions of human-environment relations and how these are being reconfigured through biotechnological innovation. Her work has been funded by the AHRC, ESRC, Barts and the London Charity Trust, British Academy, the Brocher Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, and she published widely in many of the leading Geography and interdisciplinary journals. Beth has also served as an expert participant in debates around solidarity in bioethics (Nuffield Foundation) and Personalised Medicine (European Science Foundation). (University of Southampton). Using animals in scientific research has been critical to the development of modern medicine and is contingent upon a complex, entangled network of relations and obligations across science and society. These entanglements can best be understood as the with stakeholders, scientists and publics across the Animal Research Nexus. The overall programme seeks to identify what is required to remake the social contract around animal use in 21st century science and medicine. We will be working with 5/6 post-doctoral research assistants and 2/3 PhD students, with Bentley Crudgington as creative facilitator, and engaging perspectives across the animal research nexus to answer some of the questions we raised in this This project led by Dr Jamie Lorimer and in collaboration with Dr Richard Greyner and Dr Timothy Hoggetts (School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford) aims to bring new scientific techniques for surveying microbial biodiversity out of the laboratory to explore how they can shape everyday understandings of domestic life and kitchen hygiene. The project, , will develop novel methods that will allow people to experiment on the microbial life in their kitchens and to visualise the results, and then explore the implications of this participatory approach with key stakeholders in industry and the regulatory agencies. This project (2013-2015) is a collaboration with Dr Emma Roe (University of Southampton) and funded by the Wellcome Trust. It uses a compilation of in-depth interviews and participant observation to try and understand how laboratory animal technologists 'do the right thing' or put animal welfare and ethics into practice through developing their professional skills and sensitivities. Beth is also a founding member of the This project (2013-2016) is a collaboration with Professor Catherine Nash (Queen Mary University of London) and the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, and is funded by an AHRC funded Collaborative Doctoral Award. Sarah Morton (PhD candidate) will use archival and ethnographic methods to explore how repatriation is put into practice and what happens subsequently to repatriated remains. The project will show how human remains are socially and materially constructed and the different meanings and associations repatriated remains hold for different stakeholders in the repatriation process. This is a collaborative project led by Mr Markus Ornstein (Homerton University Hospital), and working with Prof. Stephen Duffy (Wolfson Institute of Preventative medicine) and Professor Isabel Dyck, Dr Tim Brown and Melanie Dembinsky (School of Geography, QMUL). The project aims to trial and evaluate a , produced by Homerton Hospital in order to raise breast awareness amongst Black women. Beth is leading the qualitative arm of the project, conducting interviews and focus groups with practice staff and patients to explore the impact of the DVD on their health knowledge and to gage their responses to the DVD. The pilot study (2012-2013) and main project (2013-2015) have been funded by Barts and the London Charity Trust. This project draws on the archives of the MRC's Common Cold Unit to explore the spaces created though medical research. It examines how volunteers were recruited for common cold research and the unit's experimental spaces, protocols and practices. A key insight from the research so far has been the ways in which participation in medical research shapes science-society relations, blurring the distinction between scientific research and health care. Beth's PhD and post-doctoral research at the Open University explored the controversies surrounding Iceland's (1998) Act on a Health Sector Database, and its proposal to license a private sector firm to access anonymised public medical records for use in gene-discovery research. Her work argued that how and where humans and their derivatives become resources for medical research is central to understanding social and cultural responses to this use of bioinformation, human tissue and human subjects and their ethical implications. For the Final Honour School, Beth contributes to the 'Environmental Geography' foundation course and to an option, 'Geographies of Nature' led by Dr Jamie Lorimer. Beth also shares responsibility with her colleagues at Keble for providing tutorials for the Preliminary Examination and Final Honour School of Geography. Beth convenes and lectures on the 'Science and Politics' core course for MSc Nature, Society and Environmental Policy. Beth also offers an elective course to SoGE Masters students in 'Animal Controversies'.

The polyol pathway consists of two enzymes, the first and rate-limiting enzyme aldose reductase (AR) reduces glucose to sorbitol, and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), converts sorbitol to fructose. Using transgenic techniques she (in collaboration with Prof. Stephen Chung) showed that increased expression of AR in the lens made mice susceptible to develop diabetic cataract. By using SDH null mutant mice, she discovered that the sorbitol accumulation is the key culprit in development of in diabetic neuropathy. Later, she showed that increased expression of AR in the mouse nerves exacerbates the development of diabetic neuropathy. She also generated AR gene knockout mice, which developed mild diabetes insipidus. Using the double mutant mice with deletion of AR and SDH, she and her colleagues demonstrated that polyol pathway plays a key role in the development of various diabetic complications, including retinopathy, cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke. She worked with the pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, USA and Sanwa, Japan to further develop use of AR inhibitors in diabetic and ischemic/reperfusion injuries to the peripheral nerve, retina and brain which lead to patents. She has also created transgenic mice with over-expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in endothelial cells or astrocytes, or ET-1 KO mice and demonstrated that ET-1 also plays an important role in cardio- and cerebro-vascular function, and astrocyte biology. Prof. Chung has been continuing with the basic understanding of the regulation of AR by deleting the transcription factor, osmotic responsive element binding protein, OREBP/NFAT5, which regulate not only AR but also many important genes, such as HSP70, ion and water channels, transporters including sodium myoinositolcotransporter (SMIT). Deletion of NFAT5 leads to embryonic lethality with cardiac defect in homozygous KO mice, and more likely to develop ischemic stroke injury in heterozygous KO mice. The deletion of osmoregulatory gene, such as SMIT, lead to inability of cranial nerves to send out the cranial nerves during embryonic age leading to death due to inability to breath. Recently she is interested in GAP and GEF proteins, such as Deleted in Liver Cancer (DLC2) and Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP (Epac), which regulate RhoA or Rap1 and 2 activities, respectively. They determined that deletion of DLC2 leads to more inflammatory pain and diabetic neuropathy in mice. Deletion of Epac1 leads to metabolic syndrome with beta cell defect. Currently, these mouse models are being actively phenotype (including microarray and proteomics) to determine whether these genes are important in diabetes and its complications in various tissues, which are becoming a major health concern worldwide. Prof. Chung is also actively participating in group research program, such as Area of Excellence, Theme-based Research Program and State Key Laboratory.

Up to five different cytoplasmic IF proteins can be expressed in adult neurons and we study four of these, namely, peripherin and the neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins, NFL, NFM and NFH. Overexpression of either of these neuronal IF proteins in transgenic mice can have an adverse effect on defined populations of neurons, such as motor neurons, giving rise to a neurodegenerative disease resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The neurotoxicity of these overexpressed IF proteins appears to at least partly be due to their propensity to form aggregates. We are attempting to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms underlying these ALS-like diseases by studying pertinent signal transduction pathways in transgenic mice or in primary neuronal cultures derived from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of mouse embryos. The primary DRG cultures contain two major cell types: sensory neurons and Schwann cells, which are the glial cells that form myelin in the peripheral nervous system. In addition to neuronal studies involving IFs, we use these cultures to study myelination, which can be induced by adding ascorbate to the culture medium. We are particularly interested in the signal transduction pathways that are activated in myelinating Schwann cells and have recently implicated p38, a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which appears to exert its effect at the level of the actin cytoskeleton. The Schwann cells in DRG cultures can be selectively removed using antimitotic agents and the remaining sensory neurons can be seeded with oligodendrocytes in order to study myelination by glial cells derived from the central nervous system.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Improving the analysis of climate-related impacts on natural freshwater stores including principally groundwater but also soil moisture and ice, is a key component of on-going research. Although the use of models (analytical, statistical, numerical) plays a critical role in this research, a central aspect of this research is the use of observations, both g and GRACE satellite measurements, as observations enable the development and testing of our conceptual understanding of the relationship between climate variability and change and terrestrial freshwater stores. This research contributes directly to international scientific programmes including groundwater in enabling communities in low-income communities to adapt to the pressures of rapid development and climate variability. To date, research has focused primarily on the hydrogeology of weathered crystalline rock (saprolite-saprock) aquifer systems that underlie much of the tropics including 40% of sub-Saharan Africa and the entire Great Lakes Region of Africa (GLRA). More recently, research has been extended to include shallow alluvial aquifers in the Bengal Basin, the largest of the Asian Mega-Deltas. Research is both - seeking to resolve the capacity of both aquifer systems to sustain groundwater abstraction for irrigation and urban water supplies - and (evolutionary hydrogeology) - seeking to understand how the long-term geomorphological evolution of aquifers in both environments determines their characteristics and interactions between groundwater and surface water: My research addresses practical problems of securing and sustaining water supplies for domestic and agricultural needs in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Through direct engagement with stakeholders and decision makers together with long-term collaborations with research institutions, our research is designed to have an immediate and direct impact. Two areas where the impact of this research have been most pronounced are: Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, groundwater now features centrally in national water development strategies, national irrigation plans, and regional initiatives to improve access to drinking water and food production through irrigation and thereby contribute to the ) funded by the UK government to resolve the scientific basis for groundwater-based adaptations to climate variability and change as well as increased freshwater demand. The rationale for these plans and initiatives is rooted, in part, in collaborative research ( , this research has set a widely adopted benchmark for the quantification of groundwater resources in Africa.

Professor Chan\u2019s research interests include synaptic mechanisms underlying plastic modification of neural networks for spatial learning as well as the exploitation of pluripotent stem cell-derived glial cells and neurons in the assembly of functional neural circuits. To find the cellular and molecular regulators of plasticity in sensorimotor circuits, our studies focus on the sensitive period in postnatal development. We used novel pharmacological and genetic approaches to manipulate the sensorimotor system and monitor for cellular and molecular changes that effect behavioral outcomes. We have revealed a postnatal period critical to the modification of vestibular circuits responsible for spatial navigation. We found that excitatory-inhibitory balance within these circuits tunes synaptic plasticity for cognitive functions. We identified neuromodulators that induce or reset experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in acquisition of spatial navigation. With the use of animal models of neural injury, we found mechanisms to harness glial reactions in facilitating neuroregeneration. We also exploited human bone marrow stromal cells and pluripotent stem cells to derive glial cells and neurons in the assembly of functional neuronal networks, providing therapeutic benefits for post-traumatic regeneration of peripheral and central nerves.

We aim to identify novel genes and networks that modulate response to cancer drugs, and to uncover genetic dependencies of cancer-relevant pathways that can be exploited therapeutically. Cancer therapy is often hampered by the rapid emergence of drug resistance. This is true not only for the conventional chemotherapies, but also for genotype-directed drugs targeting those components that are mutated or deregulated in tumor cells. In addition, presence of an oncogenic driver mutation does not always confer sensitivity to the drug that inhibits that driver. Therefore, a better understanding of resistance mechanisms is essential to enable the rational development of treatment strategies to overcome this clinical challenge. Using unbiased functional genetic screens (loss- and gain-of-function), we aim to uncover novel genes and network interactions that causally modulate response to targeted cancer therapeutics. Whenever possible, the expressions of these candidate biomarkers are examined in patient tumour samples to correlate with clinical response to the cancer drugs. Complementary genetic and biochemical approaches are used to investigate the mechanism of action and to provide treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Majority of genotype-directed anticancer drugs target the gain-of-function oncogenic mutations. However, some cancer driver mutations such as loss-of-function alterations in tumour suppressors are not directly actionable. When oncogenic mutations are not directly targetable, \u201csynthetic lethality\u201d is often explored to derive highly specific cancer therapies that have minimal side effects in normal tissue. In this context, we use customized druggable gene-family shRNA/CRISPR libraries and compound collections to identify the targets whose inhibition is synthetic lethal with the driver mutations in the cancer types of interests. Our studies aim to deliver novel insights into the genetic dependencies of cancer-relevant pathways and provide effective treatment strategies, resulting in clinical benefit for cancer patients.", "tag": "aspirant"},

She is also a committee member and the equalities officer for the Oxford Branch of the University College Union. She chairs Fahamu Trust Ltd, a pan-African social justice movement building organization which publishes Dr Daley's principal research interests are threefold: firstly, on contemporary forced migration and its relationship with identity politics, especially ethnicity, gender and citizenship; secondly, how feminist geopolitics, critical race theory, and African feminist thought can together illuminate the ways in which race, gender, militarism, and violence intersect across transnational space and identify the potentialities for peaceful co-existence arising from alternative non-western centric ontologies; and thirdly, the relationship between conservation, resource extraction, and rural livelihoods within a political ecology framework. The geographical loci of research are East and Central Africa, and the UK. The study examines how new networked relationships between global capitalism, international humanitarian assistance, and local political elites affect those who have been forcedly displaced and the subsequent effects on place-based practices of citizenship. The project addresses the embodied experiences of gender and race in contemporary Africa and the African diaspora that have arisen out of pre-existing inequalities that have been aggravated by neo-liberal capitalism. Dr Daley teaches the core 'international Migration' module for the Preliminary Examinations; the Final Honour School core lectures on violence and security for the Space, Place and Society paper and on global environmental narratives and African rural communities for the Environmental Geography paper. She also teaches the option course 'African Societies', and delivers human geography tutorials for the core courses for Jesus College students.

Upon graduation she spent 3 years in a junior Faculty position at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, followed by a brief spell in the pharmaceutical industry, before joining the University of Hong Kong as a Lecturer in 1988. She was promoted to Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor in 1997. Dr. Ballard is committed to excellence in both teaching and research: she served the Faculty as Assistant Dean for Education & Student Affairs from 2004-2010 and is currently the Deputy Director of the Institute of Cardiovascular Science & Medicine. Our research is focused on the mechanisms that regulate blood flow, particularly in the skeletal muscle circulation, which undergoes large flow changes in the transition from rest to exercise. We also study the interaction between central and peripheral control mechanisms of flow regulation in situations such as exercise or systemic hypoxia. Our recent work investigates the mechanism of ATP release from the skeletal muscle cells: ATP is an important mediator of exercise hyperaema: it activates afferent nerves in the exercise pressor reflex, and is the substrate for extracellular formation of the important local vasodilator, adenosine. The rate of ATP release from skeletal muscle cells is the strongest determinant of the rate of adenosine formation in the muscle interstitial space. We have shown that ATP release from skeletal muscle is dependent on activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR): exercise lowers the intracellular pH of muscle cells, and pH-lowering elevates the intracellular cAMP concentration, resulting in Protein-Kinase-A-dependent activation of CFTR. However, ATP is not released through CFTR itself: CFTR interacts with other proteins in the muscle cell membrane so that CFTR activation brings about the opening of a separate ATP release pore. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that CFTR associates with connexin-43 and pannexin-1 in the muscle cell membrane, and current experiments are directed towards identifying the mechanism of the interaction between them. Another current focus is on the upstream signaling pathway that links the muscle contractions and low pH to the elevation of cAMP in the muscle cell. Experimental approaches employed in my laboratory range from studies of integrated mammalian physiology down to single cell systems, enzyme studies in fractionated cells and molecular methods. Techniques include interstitial microdialysis, in vivo pressure and flow measurements, HPLC, spectrophotometric assays, various gas- or ion-sensitive electrodes, confocal microscopy, intracellular pH/ion measurements using fluorescent dyes, immunostaining, RNA interference, and protein overexpression in cultured cell models.

The project also involves new work at Barnham, Suffolk. This research is building on previous work at the site by the research team (1989-1994) to investigate a number of key questions about the relationship between different artefact assemblages and the environmental signal at the site. I am also a member of a consortium led by British Museum on an English Heritage funded project which is seeking to establish the extent on-shore and off-shore of the archaeologically important deposits at Happisburgh. My role concerns the onshore geological investigations, results of which will be integrated with onshore and offshore geophysical surveys. I am also a co-investigator on the project, which is exploring the route-ways, dispersals and landscape use of different colonising populations over the last 800,000 years (800 ky) using datasets comprising 80,000 artefact records from over 600 sites held at the British Museum and in other collections.

As PI of the OPAL Water Centre, Neil led the development and management of an innovative educational national water survey programme accessible to people of all ages and abilities, promoted especially within disadvantaged communities. The Survey encouraged greater understanding of the aquatic environment through public participation in water quality and aquatic biodiversity assessment and used high quality research to link the community, voluntary and statutory sectors. Over the 6 years of the project, the OPAL Water team based at the Dept of Geography, UCL worked with many local and national organisations, community groups and individuals across the country to assess the health of the nation's lakes and ponds.Find out more about the OPAL Water Survey The OPAL Water survey involved the distribution of 40,000 free water packs, 20,000 of which were sent as class packs to schools. The OPAL Water Centre has particularly encouraged young people to participate in water science and develop an interest in the natural world via school visits, demonstrations and events delivered by UCL staff over the course of the project. These activities have led, in some cases, to the development of sustainable long-term initiatives supporting children\u2019s ongoing engagement with freshwater monitoring and conservation. Furthermore, the Cub Scouts adopted a version of the OPAL Water Survey as part of their newly revised \u2018Naturalist\u2019 badge in May 2012.Water Survey pack contents remain available for free download by any interested member of the public from the : One of the OPAL Water Centre\u2019s primary objectives was to facilitate participation in water science among demographics which might not otherwise have the opportunity. These included deprived communities, people with special educational needs, victims of domestic abuse and black and minority ethnic groups. : OPAL Water centre research enabled local groups to develop conservation policies and also provided key data for the UK contribution to a 2010 consultation on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. This arose from the OPAL Water team\u2019s detailed monitoring and research at 9 lakes across England providing new data on pollutants listed as Priority Hazardous Substances under the European Union's Environmental Quality Standards Directive (2008/105/EC), such as mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and brominated flame retardants. A report to Defra produced by AEA Technology used OPAL water and fish data to provide evidence for bioaccumulation of HBCD (hexabromocyclododecane) in UK freshwaters to demonstrate that \u201cvalues are well above the bioaccumulation criterion...for listing under the Stockholm Convention\u201d. It noted that no other UK data were available and made specific reference to OPAL research outputs, concluding these data provided \u201cample evidence of bio-accumulation\u2026of HBCD in biota\u201d. HBCD has since been included in the Stockholm Convention for proposed elimination. At a local level, the OPAL Water Centre provided data on Fleet Pond in Hampshire to Hart District Council to help their restoration strategy (first phase 2012\u201315). Hart District Council\u2019s Fleet Pond Management Plan 2010-2015 drew on OPAL Water Centre bathymetric, sediment and aquatic biota monitoring survey data. Dredging of Fleet Pond began in March 2012 and OPAL data will additionally be used to help assess the success of current restoration activities.

ENSIS is a company dedicated to supporting the research of the Environmental Change Research Centre and is thus integral to its research activities. Neil's work via ENSIS includes trace metal and toxicology studies undertaken for DEFRA and involvement in the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network (now the Upland Water Monitoring Network) since 1988. In addition, the use of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) as a means to date sediment cores is widely used in projects undertaken by ENSIS. Lochnagar is a mountain loch located to the south-west of the Cairngorms in Scotland. It has been part of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network since 1988 and a key site for European mountain lake research projects. In August 2002, an automatic camera was deployed in the catchment. The camera took a photograph of the loch and the western part of the catchment everyday at midday. Amongst other things, this allowed us to follow the extent and duration of snow and ice cover and to observe how the ice moved during melting. In 2008, after 6 years of enduring some of the harshest weather in the UK, the camera failed and was removed. The following videos show these daily pictures as short time-lapse sequences. Each covers the photographs of Lochnagar over a calendar year. The sequences are largely unedited. Only a few images have been removed when the camera lens was obscured by snow or rain drops.", "tag": "peer"},

He has published more than 40 peer-reviewed articles including papers in Science, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Journal of Biological Chemistry, The EMBO Reports, Journal of Cell Science, Diabetes and Endocrinology. when he was a postdoctoral fellow at GeneticsInstitute, Inc. (GI). His lab first demonstrated that FOXM1 over-expressionstimulates cyclin B1 expression and enhances progression through the G2/M phase of the cellcycle. FOXM1 was later shown by Dr. Yao\u2019s lab to be regulated byMAPK signaling, strongly indicating a pivotal role played by FOXM1 in mediating thegrowth promoting effect of mitogens. Further, Dr. Yao and his collaboratorsdiscovered that FOXM1 regulates the transcription of the estrogen receptor a in breast cancercells and is involved in the regulation of cervical cancer progression and themigration/invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that FoxM1 counteracts oxidative stress-inducedsenescence and stimulates Bmi-1 expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Recently, Dr. Yao\u2019slab presented evidence to support the hypothesis that the b isoform, which is frequentlyover-expressed in cancers, represents a more active form of FOXM1. Most recently, Dr. Yao has initiated collaboration with Prof Y Tan (Hunan U) to investigate the role of FOXM1 in the regulation of genome stability and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells. as a highly expressed gene in pancreatic beta cells when he was a postdoctoral fellow at GI. PDZD2, with a relative molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa, contains six different PDZ protein\u2013protein interaction domains, which are thought to act as molecular scaffolds to facilitate the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Dr. Yao\u2019s lab demonstrated that PDZD2 is proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 to generate the secreted protein, sPDZD2. This is analogous to the processing of pro-IL-16 to generate the secreted cytokine, IL-16. Expression of sPDZD2 in pancreas and other tissues suggests an extracellular signaling function for sPDZD2. Dr. Yao and his collaborators showed that sPDZD2 exists at high levels in human fetal pancreas and in pancreatic progenitor cells derived from human fetus. Recent studies revealed that depletion of both the full-length and secreted forms of PDZD2 in rat insulin-secreting INS-1E cells led to dramatic attenuation of mRNA expression of , whereas addition of recombinant sPDZD2 (at 10-10 M) stimulated the expression of these beta-cell genes and the activity of the insulin promoter. Interestingly, depletion of the full-length form (but not the secreted form) of PDZD2 in two gene-trap mutant mouse lines led to increased basal insulin secretion, revealing a novel role for PDZD2 in the regulation of basal insulin secretion probably via modulation of KATP channel activity (2016) The Forkhead box transcription factor FOXM1 is required for the maintenance of cell proliferation and protection against oxidative stress in human embryonic stem cells.

Our long-term objectives are to translate knowledge obtained in laboratory mouse models, into clinical outcomes through the creation of novel diagnostic tools or new small molecules modulators with therapeutic value in the corresponding human disease. We are currently focusing on three major human diseases known to have clear genetic component: infectious diseases, cancer, and the birth defect spina bifida. Our genetic platform is based on the use of genetically diverse mouse inbred strains, recombinant congenic strains, and experimentally induced mutagenized mouse stocks (ENU mutants). Our research on infectious diseases focuses on pathogens that invade and replicate inside host cells, and that use this strategy to evade the immune system and other normal host defenses. These pathogens include (cerebral malaria). In these research programs, we have cloned major genes that regulate response to infections, and in the case of complex genetic control, we have isolated single gene effects in unique recombinant or mutant mouse strains. In the area of mycobacteria, we have shown that a transporter of metal ions (such as iron and manganese), which is expressed at the membrane of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes formed in macrophages, is critical to restrict intracellular replication of these microbes. The protein (known as Nramp1 or Slc11a1) acts as a biological chelator to remove from the phagosomal space metal ions that are required for metabolic activity and survival of the pathogen. In mice, Nramp1 mutations cause susceptibility to a number of infections including Mycobacteria, but also other pathogens such as . In humans, it was demonstrated that sequence polymorphisms at NRAMP1 are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy in areas of endemic disease. We are currently studying the mechanism of transport of Nramp1 and are searching for bacterial proteins and biochemical pathways that activity is dependent on Nramp1 metal ions substrates, and that may be targeted for drug discovery. , we have shown that mouse strains susceptible to this infection carry mutations in a protein known as Naip5/Birc1e. This cytoplasmic protein forms part of an ancient antigen-recognition system known as the NLR family, which includes both cell surface and intracellular receptors that recognize so-called PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) in a manner distinct from that of the normal immune system. Upon infection of these cells, Naip5/Birc1e is essential for early intracellular sensing of products by macrophages. Sensing of bacterial products by Naip5/Birc1e results in stimulation of a multiprotein complex known as the inflammasome that amplifies the molecular signal. Activation of this pathway antagonizes the virulence determinants that allow to otherwise survive inside the phagosome. We have also observed that two members of the IRF transcription factors family (namely IRF1 and IRF8) play an important role in macrophage defenses against , acting either downstream or in parallel of Naip5/Birc1e signaling. We are currently using transcript profiling with microarrays and a proteomic approach to identify additional genes and proteins which expression and or phosphorylation status is modulated by Naip5/Birc1e signaling in response to Tuberculosis remains one of the major threats to global health, and there is an acknowledged role for genetic factors in disease susceptibility. In a mouse model of aerosol infection with , we have shown that a locus on chromosome 7 is partly responsible for the complex genetic control of the inter-strain difference in susceptibility between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. We have created special mouse strains in which the resistance-associated copy of chromosome 9 has been isolated on a genetically susceptible background. These strains are being used to characterize the molecular basis of the effect and to ultimately clone the gene responsible. Studying the mouse strain BXH2 in the same infection model, we have shown that mutations in the myeloid-specific transcription factor known as Icsbp/IRF8 completely impair natural defenses against TB, with the animals dying rapidly of fulminant infection. Deficiency in Icsbp/IRF8 also impairs innate and acquired immunity to a number of other infections, including typhoid and malaria. We are presently using genome wide approaches such as chromatin immunoprecipitation on tiling arrays (ChIP on chip), and transcript profiling in macrophages from mutant animals to identify and validate transcriptional targets of IRF1 and IRF8. Such genes constitute good candidates for possible alterations in humans suffering from innate susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. , has a complex life cycle that involves both an insect vector and a mammalian host. In the latter, various forms of the Plasmodium parasites replicate in different cell types including hepatocytes, and erythrocytes where it induces a severe anemia. The subsequent accumulation of parasitized erythrocytes in brain capillaries is responsible for the severe and lethal cerebral pathology. Using as a model for blood-stage replication of the parasite, we have mapped a number of loci that affect replication of the pathogen inside red cells. Furthermore, have shown that deficiency in the erythrocyte form of pyruvate kinase protects mice against malaria. More recently, we have also shown that homozygocity or heterozygosity for mutant PKLR alleles protects human erythrocytes against infection with . We have also shown that a mutation in the Vnn3 gene (that codes for a pantetheinase) causes susceptibility to blood-stage malaria. The pantetheinase product cysteamine is essential for early response to the parasite, and we can protect otherwise susceptible mice against malaria by pre-treating them with cysteamine. We are currently testing the clinical potential of cysteamine (used alone or in combination with artemisinin) as a novel prophylactic treatment against malaria in humans. infection in humans is cerebral malaria (CM). This pathology is invariably lethal, and is caused by the accumulation of parasitized erythrocytes in the microvasculature, including the blood brain barrier. This accumulation causes a strong, host-driven, inflammatory response in situ that exacerbates pathology, and ultimately causes come and death. In mouse, CM can be induced by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. We have mapped a novel locus on chromosome 19 (berr4) that controls susceptibility to CM in mouse strains BALB/c (resistant) and C57BL/6J (susceptible). We are currently studying the mechanism by which Berr5 exert its protective effect. We have also initiated a large genomic screen in ENU-mutagenized mice to identify novel genes and pathways involved in susceptibility to CM, in particular genes and proteins that cause the massive and lethal inflammation in P. berghei infected animals. , we have reported that susceptibility to infection in the A/J mouse strain is caused by a mutation in the complement component C5a. These studies showed that C5a is not only required for the destruction of C. albicans by mononuclear phagocytes, but have established that C5a acts as a potent early chemotactic factor to recruit neutrophils, and monocytes at the site of the primary infection. Recently, we have identified several inbred strains of mice that have normal C5a function, but yet are susceptible to C. albicans infection, and vice versa. The genetic determinants responsible for this susceptibility are currently being mapped out. Our laboratory has worked for many years on the phenomenon of multidrug resistance in tumor cells, as caused by members of the P-glcoprotein (MDR) and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) family. More recently, we have studied resistance to two groups of drugs that are used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, namely the nuceloside analog arabinocytosine (cytarabine), and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (Valcade). We are currently studying the mechanism by which Bortezomib induces cell death via formation of stress granules, and activation of programmed cell death, and how Bortezomib resistant cell lines developed in our laboratory can survive these effects of the drug. More recently, we have turned our attention to genetic determinants involved in pre-disposition to cancer. In this new project, we have used chemical carcinogenesis with azoxymethane (AOM) to induce colorectal tumors in mice. We have screened several inbred strains of mice for differences in susceptibility to colorectal cancer induced by AOM, measured by the type, number and size of lesions detected in the colon. In this assay, A/J mice are susceptible while C57BL/6J mice are highly resistant. Using a unique set of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic mouse lines, we have determined that the genetic basis for this difference in susceptibility is caused by a single major locus, that we have named Ccs3. The locus maps on chromosome 3, and the minimal genetic and physical interval for this region contains an estimated ~50 genes. These genes are currently being investigated for their pattern of tissue and cell-specific expression, and for the presence of mutations in either normal tissues or in DNA from tumors emerging in susceptible animals. We are also interrogating human primary tumor samples for alterations in human homologs of the mouse genes present in the Ccs3 interval. Finally, we have developed a model of inflammation-induced colorectal cancer, induced by dextran sulfate and AOM. We are investigating the genetic basis of differential susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to colorectal tumors induced by this treatment. Neural tube defects (NTD) such as spina bifida are very common in humans, and rank second only to cardiac defects in inborn errors. Our laboratory has been studying two mouse models of NTD, namely the splotch mouse, and more recently the looptail (Lp) mouse. Mice homozygote for the Lp mutation suffer from a very severe form of neural tube defect called craniorachischisis. This condition is lethal in utero. Using a positional cloning approach, we found that the Lp defect is caused by mutations in the membrane protein Vangl2. This protein is a mammalian homolog of the fly /strabismus, a gene known to be involved in regulating the development of certain structures in the fly, being part of a pathway known as the PCP pathway, standing for planar cell polarity. Flies with mutations in this pathway have defect in the organization of several appendages and structures (wings, eyes), which is caused by an inability of epithelial cells to properly organize in the planar polarity field. This pathway is highly conserved from flies to humans, and in mammals this pathway is also involved in certain types of morphogenic movements during embryogenesis known as convergent extension; Again, this pathway involves the dynamic rearrangement and migration of epithelial cells to form primordial structures, including the neural tube, the heart, the kidney and others. genes, Vangl1 and Vangl2 that encode for highly similar membrane proteins. We recently detected mutations in the human VANGL1 gene in familial and sporadic cases of spina bifida. We have also recently determined that VANGL1 and VANGL2 genetically interact in the regulation of neurogenesis and in the appearance of neural tube defects in mice. These exciting findings suggest that the VANGL family may play a critical role in the etiology of this malformation. We are currently investigating large number of clinical cases to determine the frequency of such mutations, and are exploring the molecular basis for the loss of function in these patients. This is being investigated in mouse models, but also in zebra fish, where the human gene can correct the neural tube defect detected in fish embryos showing a defect in the corresponding fish homolog. Biochemically, we are investigating the multiprotein complex formed by Vangl proteins at the membrane and that is responsible for providing polarity information to the cells, and how alterations in this complex may cause spina bifida in humans.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Cellular stress can arise due to various reasons, such as the perturbation/loss of intra- or extracellular homeostasis, the production of toxic metabolites, damages of intracellular macromolecules, etc. Mechanisms exist in cells that are able to sense and to respond to the presence of cellular stress. Such mechanisms are crucial to the health and development of a multi-cellular organism. Our group is particularly interested in oxidative stress response mechanisms in cells. Oxidative stress is due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Firstly, we would like to understand how ROS might function as signaling molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We demonstrated previously that treatment of cells with a synthetic retinoid known as fenretinide resulted in the expression of the growth-arrest and DNA-damage inducible (Gadd153) gene. Further study of this effect of fenretinide revealed that this retinoid led to the stabilization of the Gadd153 mRNA, most probably through an ROS-dependent mechanism. We are currently investigating the molecular components that are involved in the ROS-mediated regulation of mRNA-stability. Secondly, we are also interested in the metabolism of ROS with a view to understanding how cells might be protected from ROS-induced cellular stress and how ROS might function as an intracellular messenger. The thioredoxin reductase and its substrate thioredoxin are both involved in the redox metabolism of ROS, utilizing electrons donated by NADPH. Under normal circumstances, this system contributes to the overall capacity of a cell to scavenge ROS. Initially known for its role in ROS metabolism, increasing evidence suggests that thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system is involved in the growth and development of normal and abnormal cells. Our studies in the thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system include the investigation of the regulation of intracellular thioredoxin reductase activity at the transcription and post-translational level. Ongoing projects are aimed to elucidate the signaling pathways that regulate the transcription of the thioredoxin reductase gene and the stability of the enzyme protein. Another topic that is of interest to us is apoptosis: a response option that may be selected by cells in the event of stress. Previously, we obtained evidence that the ?-opioid receptor agonist (U50488H) was a potentiating agent for apoptosis through a pathway that apparently involved the Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate/Ca 2+-signaling pathway. We are currently investigating how such a pathway may act as a signaling pathway for apoptotic cell death. , Maria P. Wong, Zhengyuan Xia, George S. W. Tsao, Michael Q.

(2006) looks at how the interplay between urban modernity and development frames a conceptual and practical divide between \"Western\" and \"Third World\" cities. The book develops the claim that urban theory needs to be more cosmopolitan in the resources it draws on; and argues that urban development policies need to move beyond developmentalism and draw on the wider cultural and economic resources of urbanism in poorer cities. More recent writing extends this argument to develop appropriate methods and tactics for international theorisation of 21 century cities, organised around the conceptualisation of comparative urbanism, and a book on this topic is under preparation. Grant applications and research in progress explore questions of the geopolitics of policy mobility; international theorisation of global city-regions; and activist research on London\u2019s city strategies. These all take forward methodological experiments for an international urban theory. Previous research has centred on the relationship between power and space, specifically in cities and mostly in relation to South African politics. For example, I have written on the 1936 Empire Exhibition in Johannesburg to explore spaces of racial interaction in South African cities. I have also written on issues in feminist politics, including questions of difference and methodology, and more recently on the implications of Julia Kristeva's psychoanalytic writing for feminist theorizations of space. More broadly, I have explored ways of postcolonializing the theoretical and empirical practices of Geography. A seminal critique of the dominant global and world cities analysis with respect to its implications for wider urban studies and for the politics of development in poorer cities has been drawn on in background and published policy documents which have informed the conceptualisation of urban development in South African cities, e.g. the background review document for the 2006-2011 Growth and Development Strategy which scoped international experience in city strategies and established an approach to Johannesburg\u2019s strategic policy. Robinson was invited to speak to city councillors and officials in Johannesburg on various occasions (2004; 2011) and on their study tour to London (2006) informing ongoing strategic policy development in this period. The research is planned to be taken forward in a collaboration with the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) on conceptualising global city-regions. : Studies of the politics of Johannesburg\u2019s City Strategy led to Robinson being invited to review and comment on the draft revised GDS2040 at the Johannesburg City Council\u2019s international conference as part of the consultation process in October 2011, including speaking to a mass public gathering and on the main morning news television. These contributions encouraged the strategy\u2019s commitment to a broadly balanced and locally resonant range of policy commitments. 1) Desktop review of international experiences with city strategies to which Robinson inputs were noted as helpful \u2013 document available from Robinson. 2) SACN State of South African Cities Report (2006) \u2013 setting guidance 2006-2011 for city strategy development across 9 metros \u2013 available at .

My particular interest is collective culture and the capacity of urban space to generate new forms of sociality and solidarity. Focused on contemporary London and cities across the U.S., my research to date has centred on three themes: . A longstanding concern in critical urban scholarship, my work has sought re-animate this field of study. This includes advocating for careful attention to how different spaces of public life are put together and to the affects that different kinds of materiality, infrastructure and modes of inhabitation have in making spaces what they are. I am also interested on-going, everyday forms of negotiation about what is fair and appropriate for living together in a pluralistic society. . Focusing on food-related trends, I have examined emergent forms of popular practice and the efforts of people actively seeking to foster more convivial forms of urban life. By closely studying social interactions in novel kinds of spaces and the more extra-ordinary activities of social entrepreneurs, my interest is to explore possibilities for living together in more mutually beneficial ways. . Parallel to my interest in urban public life is a concern with popular and academic discourse about cities and neighbourhoods themselves. This includes examining how we understand and portray processes of urban change, new developments and trends, and the lifestyles and culture of different kinds of urban dwellers. In particular, I am concerned with understanding the work that different kinds of representation do and the geographical imaginations they enable. My work has been supported by grants from the Economic and Social Research Council, University College London\u2019s Graduate School, University College London\u2019s Public Engagement Unit, and the American Association of Geography\u2019s Urban Geography Research Group. Since 2011 I have been an organising committee member and communication director for the Royal Geographical Society\u2019s Urban Geography Research Group. I was also a founding member of the Stadkolloquium Urban PhD Research Network. Currently, I am putting together a 40-entry volume entitled Key Thinkers on Cities (co-edited with Dr. Alan Latham of UCL Geography) to be published with SAGE in 2016. I am foremost an enthusiastic teacher and student. My first degree was in Education and the Social Sciences, followed by an MSc in Teaching and Learning. My first job was teaching middle school in Kansas City, Kansas and then secondary school in London, where I also managed a successful secondary Geography department for five years. After completing my PhD at UCL, I became a teaching fellow in the department of Geography where I helped to convene the MSc Urban Studies programme and was shortlisted for the Student Choice Excellence in Teaching Award in 2015. Over the past four years, I have taught field-intensive courses on London\u2019s Urban Geographies and Encountering Global London for St. Lawrence University of New York. A longer-term goal is to publish a volume on teaching methods for helping students actively engage in learning by exploring the cities in which they live and visit. My ESRC-funded doctoral research at University College London was an ethnographic study of food-related trends across the U.S. My interest was to examine some of the novel ways in which the spaces of public life are being re imagined and to invigorate the study of public space in social science research. The project builds upon a critique of predominant approaches to urban public space, arguing that recent work on the topic has reached something of an empirical and theoretical impasse. In pressing for a more expansive imaginary, the project has worked to develop a broader conceptualisation of public-ness along with a series of analytic principles, theoretical resources and attentive registers for opening up new lines of inquiry. Organised around the theme of \u2018eating in public\u2019, empirical case studies include: the tremendous growth and popular enthusiasm for street food vending, and a comparative look at how municipal licensing laws have variously nurtured or restricted the practice underground restaurants and secret supper clubs in which public audiences are invited into private homes for meals, and the changing forms of public/private relations transformed by the so-called sharing economy pay-what-you-can-restaurants and community cafes in which customers determine the price of their meal, and the material-practical configurations that help to sustain relations of conviviality and accountability within these spaces As the starting point for future work in this vein, my goal is to help facilitate discussion, research and innovation in how more convivial, inclusive and democratic forms of collective life might be nurtured. This project examined a small-scale urban redevelopment that sought to transform a traffic junction best known for crime and anti-social behaviour into a public space that would be an asset for the local community. Research involved an ethnographic study in which I worked on-site as a fruit and vegetable vendor over a period of three months. The aim was to attend to the fine-grained details of how public life was being reconfigured by the changes, and to extend the conceptual registers through which transformations to urban public spaces might be apprehended.

Natural and synthetic analogs of these substances are used extensively to control a broad spectrum of human diseases including cancer. The effects of each hormone depend primarily on a protein referred to as a receptor. The study of these receptors is important to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular response to these inducers. This is a group of novel steroid hormone-like receptors for which the ligands remain unknown. Our research program in this area is aimed at identifying novel hormones and the function of their receptors during development, homeostasis and in cancer cells. The research endeavors of my laboratory in this area are directed toward understanding the molecular basis of vitamin A action. We are generating genetically altered mouse strains to study the role of retinoid receptors in cancer progression. These studies should improve our basic knowledge of retinoid physiology and lead to a better understanding of the role of retinoids in suppressing the development of neoplastic cells. Perhaps one of the most exciting long-term hopes in breast cancer treatment is that a better understanding of the role of hormones in mammary differentiation, such as that which occurs during mammary gland development and potentially protects against breast cancer, will lead to new effective strategies in breast cancer prevention and treatment. Thus, our research is directed at improving our knowledge of the roles of estradiol, an ovarian hormone implicated in the growth and proliferation of normal and abnormal mammary cells. Using approaches, our current objectives are to study the signaling pathways implicated in the activation of its two receptors (alpha and beta) during mammary gland development. It is hoped that our molecular and genetic analysis of orphan nuclear receptors, retinoid action and estrogen receptors will lead to an increase in our understanding of these hormone-based systems which, in turn, will help develop more efficient therapy for treatment of cancer.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Currently, my work concentrates on the role of antioxidants from medicinal herbs, phytochemical agents and multi-functional drugs (M30) on inflammation and oxidative stress in liver diseases, particularly in non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is one of the leading causes of chronic liver injury across the world. It is also strongly related to other pathological conditions, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Pathogenesis of NAFLD remains not fully characterized but is generally attributed to the occurrence of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and necro-apoptosis. Every potential therapeutic strategy should target one or some of these pathological events in the liver. Over the past decades, application of herbal treatment for NAFLD received increasing attentions due to its wide availability, low side effects, and proven therapeutic mechanisms and benefits. . NAFLD is now recognized to be one of the risk factors in metabolic syndrome and also in liver cancer. The exact mechanism in the development of NAFLD remains poorly understood including the precise therapeutic management.

Since joining QMUL in 2003 I have taught a wide range of undergraduate topics including environmental hazards, palaeoecology and Geographical Information Systems. I like to integrate lectures with workshops, seminars and practical work in the classroom or laboratory and in the field, and I am active in developing and using e-learning resources. Aspects of my research are incorporated into my teaching. For example, over the past five years, lectures and practical exercises based on my Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range method featured in the second year Global Environmental Change and Digital Worlds modules. Consequently, several students became sufficiently interested and enthused to undertake successful major projects aimed at developing, testing and applying aspects of the method, leading in turn to postgraduate work on the same topic in two cases and in a third case to co-authorship of a research publication. Thus both research and teaching have benefited from the integration of an innovative palaeoclimate application with undergraduate coursework. Research links have also enabled me to arrange for guest speakers on undergraduate modules, as well as specialist-hosted group visits to the Natural History Museum. module. In 2013 I received the QMUL Students' Union Assessment & Feedback award. I gained a Higher Education Academy Teaching Fellowship in 2016. Ostracods are common microfossils in Quaternary (Pleistocene and Holocene) deposits. Their ecological diversity makes them useful as palaeoenvironmental proxies in oceanic, coastal and continental settings; they are also particularly valuable for reconstructing past climatic conditions (e.g. with the ) and can be helpful for correlating and establishing the relative ages of the deposits in which they are found. My research involves all of these applications, often as a member of a multidisciplinary team, as well as studies of Recent (living) ostracod taxonomy, ecology and distribution which are essential to understand better their significance as fossil proxies. The value of ostracods value as Quaternary palaeoclimate proxies, through indicator species, transfer function, mutual climatic range and geochemical approaches, is the focus of a major book project to which 39 international authors contributed, of which I was the lead editor and which was published at the end of 2012. I use ostracods as palaeoclimate proxies in various ways. My Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range (MOTR) method combines nonmarine ostracod distributional data (e.g. from the ) with modern climate data to establish species\u2019 mean air temperature ranges (e.g. for January and July); thus calibrated, overlapping ranges of fossil ostracods in Quaternary assemblages are used to determine the mutual temperature range within which they could have lived. This has facilitated quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions for British Pleistocene archaeological sites including Boxgrove and Purfleet and is currently being used in multiproxy studies of Quaternary sites in Italy, Germany, Estonia and Canada. The primary \"training set\" source for the MOTR method is the NODE database, initiated by members of an EU-funded project ( : 2004\u20132008). It currently contains approximately 10,000 records of living species and 2,000 fossil (Quaternary) records; as database steward I welcome approaches from anyone interested in contributing to or using it. NODE is linked to other regional databases via the OMEGA will be a global dataset, with applications in palaeoclimate, biodiversity and biogeography research, combining regional datasets and harmonising their taxonomy. OMEGA will be realised through international collaboration and sharing of regional ostracod databases such as The widely accepted \u201cPlatycopid Signal\u201d Hypothesis claims that fossil ostracod assemblages dominated by the Order Platycopida signal dysaerobic conditions on the sea floor, based on the premise that filter-feeding platycopids, able to pass more water over their respiratory surface, were better-equipped than other ostracods to survive in poorly oxygenated waters. I and co-authors have challenged claims of modern biological and ecological support for the Platycopid Signal and have advanced an alternative interpretation, suggesting that platycopid dominance may signify oligotrophy rather than dysaerobia, because living platycopids appear adapted to filter-feed on nano- and picoplankton which are predominant in oligotrophic conditions. The mid-Mesozoic was a time of explosive global diversification of nonmarine ostracod faunas, establishing lineages that persist to this day. My research on ostracod assemblages of Jurassic\u2013Cretaceous continental deposits (the \"Purbeck-Wealden\" in Britain) includes revisions of their taxonomy, biostratigraphical zonation schemes and palaeoenvironmental interpretations that have implications for Mesozoic nonmarine basins worldwide. The application of a palaeobiological approach to the interpretation of Purbeck-Wealden ostracod assemblages has been particularly rewarding; for example, a combination of pollen and ostracod fossils provided evidence for temporary freshwater pond conditions associated with a dinosaur skeleton in a Cretaceous Weald Clay pit in Surrey. Ostracod shells provide the best fossil record of any arthropods, extending back 500 million years, but the rarity of preservation of their appendages and other \"soft parts\" impedes efforts to understand their phylogenetic relationships. Ostracods are well-known for providing examples of geographical parthenogenesis and unusual longevity of asexual reproduction. As a micropalaeontologist I collaborate with zoologists, ecologists and molecular biologists in studying ostracods and crustacean phylogeny as well as the evolutionary ecology of sex and parthenogenesis, e.g. as a participant in the EU-funded project: (Jones, 1850) in its type area and stratigraphical context: potential for mapping the freshwater/estuarine boundaries of the Thames\u2013Medway river system in the MIS9 and MIS11 interglacials. 2014.

We use the tools of molecular and cell biology to study problems in this field. The long-term research goals focus on understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of mRNA half-lives and how they affect cell growth and differentiation. mRNA stability influences gene expression in virtually all organisms, from bacteria to mammals. In mammalian cells, the abundance of a particular mRNA can fluctuate dramatically due to a change in mRNA half-life, without any change in transcription. The processes that regulate mRNA half-lives can thus affect how a cell grows, differentiates and responds to its environment. Understanding these processes requires a combination of different approaches; molecular biology and biochemistry techniques will help to understand the molecular mechanisms by which mRNA stability and degradation are regulated during cell division and differentiation and the cell biological technology will help to establish the connection between them. Towards these goals, we are using and developing methods to facilitate the identification and the characterization of factors involved in the stabilization as well as in the degradation of mRNAs in mammalian cells. Although these two phenomena are well-studied separately, very little is known about how they are integrated inside the cell. We do not know the factors that bridge and thus allow cross talk between the two processes. Since many cancer cells exhibit changes in mRNA half-lives, a precise balance between the two processes is needed to preserve cell integrity. Therefore, it is important to define the link between mRNA stabilization and degradation, and to establish how both are regulated inside the cell. Making this connection will help to clarify how and why many cancers start and will provide new targets for future therapy.", "tag": "aspirant"},

While first discovered in C. elegans, now a recognized group of related phenomena broadly conserved in eukaryotes is generally known as RNA-mediated interference, or RNAi. Central actors to these phenomena are small ~18-25nt non-coding RNAs which are matured by the RNase type III Dicer, and assembled with the Argonaute proteins into a variety of effector silencing complexes. RNAi was first recognized for its potential as a research tool and for the therapeutic promises it holds. It is now widely used in all fields of biomedical research. Soon after its discovery it became clear that the RNAi-related phenomena serve a profound physiological purpose. In one such mechanism termed microRNA-mediated silencing, small RNAs are derived from gene-encoded hairpins and negatively regulate gene expression by base-pairing and silencing messenger RNA by post-transcriptional means. According to predictions, they exert a direct negative regulation pressure on more than 30% of the entire coding gene set. In agreement with such spectacular estimates, microRNA targets have been implicated in the broadest range of cellular functions in developmental, and steady-state contexts. Consistently, some of the small RNA expression events were recently shown to be functionally important for transformation and tumor growth. More recently, yet novel RNAi-related phenomena have emerged. While RNAi was originally thought to be a sequence-directed innate immunity response, these new forms of RNAi (named here loosely endoRNAi) appear to serve other fundamental functions such as mediating heterochromatin formation or consolidation. Loss of machinery involved in endoRNAi results in a broad genetic instability, loss of chromosomes during mitosis, as well as localized and global gene mis-expression. Data from a variety of model systems support a model whereas small RNAs are derived from chromatin loci, and converge back on genomic regions to mediate changes in levels of chromatin folding by directing histone modifications. While these new functions for RNAi are only emerging, it is clear that they will have deep implications on our understanding of how the genome is organized and protected. They also offer a whole new set of possibilities to explain how cellular processes can be altered during the emergence of cancer. My research program has two aims: 1- Understanding the molecular basis for the gene regulatory functions of endogenous RNAi, and 2- Defining small RNA expression events, which are critical for development, and cancer ontogeny.

He then undertook clinical training in microbiology and internal medicine, before he joined the Department of Physiology at HKU in 1995. In 1998, Shiu received the University Teaching Award (University Teaching Fellow) as a recognition of his excellence as a teacher. His laboratory focuses on unraveling the signaling mechanisms of the neurohormone melatonin and the development of melatonin for prostate cancer prevention and treatment. in developed countries. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and effective drugs that can prevent or slow the development and progression of the disease. Melatonin, a circadian and seasonal hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland, modulates biorhythms and inhibits cancer growth. An inverse relationship between melatonin production and human prostate cancer incidence has been shown by epidemiological and clinical studies, which suggested a potential prostate tumor suppressive function of melatonin. Over the years, the aforementioned circumstantial evidence provided by epidemiological and clinical studies was corroborated by laboratory and clinical data of Shiu\u2019s research team, who had demonstrated melatonin MT receptor expression in human prostate cancer tissues, and an antiproliferative action of melatonin on prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice. Of note, subsequent administration of melatonin by Shiu and his colleagues to a castrated prostate cancer patient, whose prostate tumor tissue expressed MT receptor, was found to slow the early biochemical progression of this patient\u2019s castration-resistant tumor. This proof-of-concept translational study in a human subject indicates that the MT receptor plays a crucial role in transducing the direct suppressive action of melatonin on prostate cancer. Using androgen receptor-positive LNCaP, 22Rv1, VCaP and RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cell models, Shiu\u2019s research team then successfully delineated the major antiproliferative signaling pathways in prostate tumor cells which are activated by MT receptor stimulation. Based on their results, Shiu proposes that melatonin, a small, non-toxic and non-patentable molecule, is a promising drug candidate for prostate cancer chemoprevention, and that androgen depletion and melatonin repletion (ADMR) is a novel strategy in castration-resistant prostate cancer therapy which deserves further testing in clinical trials. Besides melatonin, Shiu and his collaborator have also identified a novel action of the human secreted PDZ domain-containing protein 2 (sPDZD2) in suppressing prostate tumor growth, on which a US patent has been granted. \u2192 denotes activation (may involve multiple steps); \u2014\u05c0 denotes inhibition (may involve multiple steps).

It is stimulating because we are actually learning something completely new which we haven\u2019t done before\u2019 This consortium project is aimed at quantifying both the flux and dynamics of the lateral exchange of organic carbon between landscape and rivers, and how this in turn modulates the transport of nitrogen and phosphorus towards the coast. Our research aims to understand the movement of these macronutrients through the different tributaries of the River Avon in Wiltshire, and how the movement of these different macronutrients varies across the different geological settings (clay, chalk and sandstone) through which the river flows. A summary document of preliminary findings can be This research is being funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council as part of the Macronutrient Cycles thematic programme. Further information about the programme can be found at the following website: Lowland peat soils occupy a relatively small proportion of the overall peatland area in England and Wales, but store large amounts of carbon (C) and are subject to disproportionately high levels of land-use pressure. To date, most measurements of C and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from UK peatlands have been made within upland blanket bogs, and it is doubtful whether the data obtained from these studies can be extrapolated to lowland systems. This study will provide a new comprehensive assessment of the GHG fluxes and C balance of the lowland peatland systems in England and Wales. The interaction of groundwater-surface water in the hyporheic zones of rivers during baseflow conditions, and its influence on nitrogen transport and transformations are poorly understood at a river reach scale. The predicted changes in precipitation and temperature linked to climate change may have further repercussions on the nature and extent of hydrologic exchanges in the hyporheic zones and biogeochemical processes. This project sought to elucidate both physical and chemical controls on nitrogen transport and transformations in the hyporheic zone of a groundwater fed river in Cumbria, UK. The project used a multidisciplinary approach to explore the physical hydrology, hydrogeophysics and biogeochemistry controls on N transport in the hyporheic zone of River Leith at a reach scale. The project had the following objectives: To establish if spatial heterogeneity in the hyporheic zone leads to redox-sensitive biogeochemical \u201chotspots\u201d and \u201chot events\u201d that determine the rate of N transport and transformations linked to variations in the riverbed connectivity. , Byrne P,Lansdown K, Trimmer M, Zhang H (in press).

For example, I am working with the RSPB, Defra and Norfolk Broads Authority to help understand the balance of greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) exchanges within lowland floodplain environments under conservation management (Defra Consortium Award 2011; NERC CASE Award 2012). I am working with the Chiltern Chalk Streams Project and River Chess Assocation to help these stakeholders understand the impacts of human activities and river restoration projects on in-stream and floodplain biogeochemistry. A critical component of the NERC Macronutrients project (NE/J012106/1) will entail working with Defra, Environment Agency, Wessex Water and CEFAS, as well as local agricultural and land management sectors in the Hampshire Avon catchment, to help these organisations (i) understand how catchment land use changes influence nutrient transport to the coast, and greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere; and (ii) to develop and explore nutrient mitigation strategies.", "tag": "peer"},

Within this field the research concentrates on numerical modelling of flows at the small end of the meso-scale range. These flows are thermally generated due to the inhomogeneity of the surface and have significance in the contexts of both pure and applied science. The most obvious applications of increased understanding of the flows are in weather forecasting and air pollution studies. The research programme uses two numerical models developed in the Meteorological Office: one is a meso-scale model; the other is at a much smaller scale (virtually a Large Eddy Simulation model), appropriate for analysis of flows on the scale of 100 m. They are currently being used to analyse: both daytime and night-time flows over slopes and in valleys, concentrating upon the effects of orography, stability, entrainment, radiation and internal turbulence structure upon the creation, development and demise of the near-surface flows; the effects of polynyas on the Antarctic boundary layer; the propagation environment in coastal areas; and the urban boundary layer. Currently, two post-doctoral research assistants work on these topics. Collaboration with the Meteorological Office is particularly good. We also have links with the Joint Centre for Meso-scale Meteorology at the University of Reading and the European Research Community on Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (ERCOFTAC).

Aberrant of Nclk activity has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Nclk consists of a catalytic subunit, called cyclin dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5), and a 25 kDa regulatory subunit derived proteolytically from a 35 kDa neuronal-specific protein, called neuronal Cdk5 activator. Although Cdk5 protein exists ubiquitously, Nclk activity can only be found in brain because of the restricted expression of Cdk5 activator. This suggests that the activator is the crucial modulator for the Nclk activity. Thus our current researches focus on the identification of proteins that can interact with Cdk5 activators and can modulate the Cdk5 activity. The small Rho GTPases family (including RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1), which belongs to Ras small GTPase superfamily, is involved in a number of cellular processes including gene regulation, cell migration and cell division. Emerging evidences has shown that Rho GTPases also play a vital role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth and cell migration. One of the downstream effectors of Cdc42 and Rac1 is called p21-activated protein kinase (Pak), which contains a highly conserved N-terminal Cdc42/Rac1 binding domain and a C-terminal kinase domain. Six members of Pak kinase family have been identified and they are subdivided into 2 groups. Pak5, which belongs to the group II Pak family, is found to be highly expressed in brain and stimulates neurite outgrowth by downregulation of RhoA. Using the yeast-2 hybrid screening, we have identified several potential cellular partners of Pak5 and would like to further characterize the functional outcome of their interaction. Recently, we also found that group I Pak family member, Pak1, is overexpressed in liver cancer, which is one of the most common cancers worldwide and in Hong Kong. Thus, our researches also focus on the molecular mechanism by which Pak1 induces hepatocarcinogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that supernumerary centrosomes drive chromosomal instability and is linked to oncogenesis. Several viral oncoproteins, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E6 and E7 and hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), have been shown to transform cells by promoting centrosome abnormalities and formation of multipolar spindles. Thus it appears that induction of centrosome amplification may be a common strategy for viral-mediated oncogenesis. We have recently characterized a novel cellular centrosomal protein, which we named TAX1BP2 and have shown to play an important role in centrosome duplication. Thus we would like to understand further the molecular signaling of TAX1BP2 and how centrosome overduplication contributes to the development of cancer.

We were the first to report that ectopic expression of a helix-loop-helix protein Id-1 in cancer cells leads to activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which is involved in regulating a wide spectrum of cellular functions including proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Our recent data show that this activation is mediated by growth factors secreted by the cancer cells, which promote the proliferation, survival, as well migration and invasive potentials of esophageal cancer cells in an autocrine manner. We are interested in identifying key growth factors that mediate the oncogenic function of Id-1. This aspect has important clinical applications since systemic targeting of these growth factors may represent a novel approach in esophageal cancer therapy. We found that insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) secreted by Id-1-overexpressing ESCC cells not only exerts autocrine effects on cancer cells but can activate stromal fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which in turn instigates bone marrow-derived vascular progenitor cells to promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Downstream of Id-1, the PI3K/AKT pathway is also implicated in cancer chemoresistance but the mechanism is not fully understood. Since cancer stem cells are thought to be more resistant to chemotherapy, we hypothesize that PI3K/AKT pathway may be differentially activated in esophageal cancer stem cells, and that targeting this pathway using specific inhibitors such as LY294002 and Wortmannin may reduce the population of esophageal cancer cells expressing stem cell markers. One of our current projects is to determine if PI3K/AKT inhibition has therapeutic potential in targeting esophageal cancer stem cells. Other ongoing studies in our laboratory include using ESCC cell line models of acquired chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil, as well as ESCC cell lines that are highly invasive, to identify tumor suppressive microRNAs that can reverse chemoresistance and suppress invasion/metastasis of ESCC cells. Our goal is to obtain useful preclinical data that may translate into novel systemic therapy for this highly lethal disease.

The formation of the renal and genital systems during embryonic development involves complex molecular and cellular events. A failure to perform these cellular functions is responsible for the high frequency of urogenital malformations found in newborn (about 1:500). Interestingly, the genes involved in key steps of embryonic development are often also involved in tumor formation later on. We are interested in the molecular networks regulating processes such as cell lineage specification, epithelialization and epithelial integrity, tubular extension, apoptotic morphogenesis and proliferation control. We tackle these important questions using a combination of mouse genetics, tissue and cell culture as well as molecular and biochemical assays. A number of transcription factors have been involved in the formation of the urogenital system. We are focusing on the transcriptional network controlled by Gata3, Pax2 and Pax8 at different steps of UGS development. We have previously shown the role of Pax genes in nephric lineage specification, branching morphogenesis and nephron differentiation. We also demonstrated the requirement for Gata3 in proliferation control, duct elongation and guidance as well as tubular homeostasis. We are pursuing these studies to identify the key molecules mediating these cellular functions downstream of Pax and Gata factors. We have recently described the process by which the ureter connects to the bladder during embryonic development (distal ureter maturation). Interestingly, this process involves the elimination of a cell population by programmed cell death. We further identified LAR-family receptor protein phosphatases (PTPRF and PTPRS) as necessary for this process. We are currently pursuing the characterization of the role of LAR-family phosphatases in apoptosis-mediated morphogenesis.

It has been demonstrated that postmortem human brain section displays activated caspases, suggesting that neuronal apoptosis occurs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We (Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases) are the first to show that a novel double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is involved in \u00df-amyloid peptide-induced neuronal apoptosis. Although it is originally named as double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, recent findings have shown that PKR is a stress kinase for different stress signals. PKR is not simply involved in neuronal apoptosis; it also plays significant roles in the highly regulated degenerative processes. Apart from PKR, a major on-going project in our laboratory is to elucidate and map out how intracellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are affected by low molecular weight \u00df-amyloid (A\u00df) peptides, resulting in either autophagy or neuronal apoptosis. In addition, we are now investigating the signaling events leading to autophagic neuronal death and synaptic degeneration. Understanding of the molecular signaling pathways will definitely pave a road for a better therapeutic strategy against neurodegenerative diseases. Apart from the signaling pathways within neurons, cell-cell interaction between glia and neurons is also an important target for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, how immune responses in the central nervous system affect the fate of neurons in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and glaucoma, is another thematic study in our group. Immune responses do not often occur in the brain, but only in the presence of potent immune stimulants or neuronal injuries. Innate immune components such as microglial cells are affected by normal neurotransmission and neurons. One of our research topics is to study how immune responses of glial cells in the eye affect the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. With all the above basic science studies, we are able to engage in applied research in searching for neuroprotective agents from Chinese medicine to natural products. Through the collaboration with colleagues in School of Biological Science and Department of Chemistry, we have identified several compounds that have high potentials to be neuroprotective agents. We are attempting to develop and commercialize some of the products into pharmaceutical market. We believe that prevention of neurodegeneration is better than treatment. In recent years, we are particularly interested in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of different risk factors leading to neurodegenerative diseases. Epidemiological studies have shown that repeated episodes of depression can lead to neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. We have demonstrated that depression can be considered to be a type of neurodegeneration leading to atrophy of hippocampus. We are actively investigating how depression leads to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Apart from depression, we are also investigating high-fat diet, hypertension, cigarette smoking and systemic inflammation. All these studies will advance our knowledge of how different factors lead to aging-associated neurodegeneration, and how we can prevent neurodegeneration. Pathophysiological changes of retina to inform disease progression in the brainPathophysiological changes of retina to inform disease progression in the brain Our laboratory has been investigating pathological changes in the retina of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We could find accumulation of \u00df-amyloid peptide and hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein in the retina of transgenic mice in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. On the other hand, we could find similar pathology in glaucoma and aging-related macular degeneration. We propose that high level of \u00df-amyloid peptide can be a pathological factor triggering neurodegeneration in different forms of glaucoma. We are investigating the similarity of their pathologies so that our eyes can be a window for monitoring disease progression and efficacy of therapeutic intervention.

However, all programs share a common theme in that they use structural biological approaches to examine interactions between enzymes and small molecules (e.g. substrates, cofactors, inhibitors). The principal technique used for these studies is X-ray crystallography, complemented with small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, enzymology and computational chemistry tools. Furthermore, for many of these programs, efforts are ongoing to exploit the three-dimensional structural information for drug development using structure-based drug design approaches. Below two programs are highlighted. Over the past few decades there has been a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, and the situation has now culminated in bacteria that are effectively resistant to all clinically used antibiotics. The research is aimed at dissecting the structural basis for clinical resistance against various antibiotics. Specifically resistance mechanisms for ribosome targeting antibiotics are examined. Many of these antibiotics have lost their potency due to bacterial enzymes that either covalently modify or cleave the drugs. For example, we have determined the detailed mechanism by which aminoglycoside kinases confer resistance to drugs such as gentamicin and kanamycin, and we are currently exploiting this knowledge towards the development of next-generation antibiotics and adjuvants. Fungal infections are a rising concern in the health care sector since pathogenic fungi have become an important cause of mortality for individuals with diminished immune systems. The concern for fungal infections is amplified by the fact that there are a very limited number of antimycotic drugs available and resistance against most commonly used antifungal agents has been observed. To assist in the drug discovery process for novel antimycotic agents, we are pursuing structural studies of fungal enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of essential metabolites that are specific to fungi. These synthetic pathways are absent in mammals, and as such pose an excellent target for the development of antimicrobial drugs. For example, we have determined the structure of the fungal enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase in complex with a drug lead that is able to clear systemic candidiasis in a mouse model.

After completing his Doctorate in Oxford in 1967, he worked briefly in the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, before spending periods at CERN and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, after which he returned to Oxford in 1974. As Director of UKAEA Culham he developed and vigorously promoted the 'Fast Track' approach to the development of fusion power, which was officially adopted by the European Commission. During his mandate as Director General of CERN the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was approved and started, and major contributions from Canada, India, Japan, the Russian Federation and the USA were negotiated, and CERN's flagship Large Electron Positron collider (LEP) was successfully upgraded. As a theoretical particle physicist he worked mainly on the quark model and the theories of the strong and electro-weak forces, and how they can be tested experimentally. His contributions include developing ways to demonstrate the \"reality\" of quarks and gluons (the particles that transmit the string force that holds quarks together) in highly inelastic electron and neutrino scattering experiments, and showing that mathematical consistency requires any theory of the weak interactions to be based on a spontaneously broken gauge theory. He was Chairman of the Council of the world fusion project ITER (2007-09), the Consultative Committee for Euratom on Fusion (2003-09), the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education (2002-04), and the CERN Scientific Policy Committee (1990-92), and has served as a Vice President of the Royal Society (2008-10) and on numerous other national and international advisory committees, including the UK Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (1989-92).

In addition to their role as intercellular adhesion molecules, these proteins also function as negative immune regulators in T and B lymphocytes as well as NK cells, platelets and neutrophils. In addition, these cell surface glycoproteins function as receptors for mouse hepatitis viruses and the human CEACAM1 is the receptor for Neisseria bacteria. Our goal is to understand how CEACAM1 transmits negative regulatory signals to different cell types and the mechanisms by which these proteins perform their function. We are consistently using molecular and cell biology approaches, as well as in vivo genetic manipulation to produce either Ceacam1 gene knockout mice or transgenic mice overexpressing either wild-type or mutant versions of the protein. We are currently involved in the characterization of the associated phenotypes in these animals to understand the functions in an in vivo setting. Role of CEACAM1 proteins in tumor formation and progression: We have shown that CEACAM1 proteins, normally expressed in epithelial cells, are down-regulated early in the process of epithelial tumor development. By reintroducing the proteins in colon tumor cells having lost their expression, we have shown that these cells no longer behave like tumor cells. The downregulation of CEACAM1 protein expression is one of the major genetic changes associated with colon, liver, endometrial, prostate and breast cancers. We have shown that maintenance of the negative proliferation signals in colonic cells depends on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 and its association to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. On the other hand, CEACAM1 expression is upregulated in angiogenic situations. We are currently assessing how the up-regulation of CEACAM1 expression in endothelial cells results in tumor progression in the later phases of cancer development. We are also deciphering the role of the CEACAM1 protein in colon cancer metastasis using in vivo models. Our focus is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the modulation of the CEACAM1 expression and how this can translate into more effective therapies for cancer patients. Liver metastasis is the predominant cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality in developed countries. CEACAM1 is a cell adhesion molecule with reduced expression in early phases of CRC development and thus functions as a tumor growth inhibitor. However, CEACAM1 is up-regulated in metastatic colon cancer, suggesting a bimodal role in CRC progression. To investigate the role of this protein in the host metastatic environment, livers was also diminished. Bone Marrow-Derived Cell recruitment, attenuation of immune infiltrates and diminished CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 chemokine production participated in the reduced metastatic livers and adoptive transfer of myeloid-derived suppressor cells confirmed the involvement of these immune cells in reduction of liver metastasis.

She is active in the University promoting interdisciplinary links in Russian and East European Studies. Prof. Pallot offers a final year option in the geography honours course on the geography of Russian and East Central Europe and she lectures in the first year course on the political geography of the Cold War. Prof. Pallot supervises graduates working on Russia on topics ranging from environmental issues and rural society to contemporary urban change. Many have gone on to university posts in the UK and elsewhere. She is an active member of the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies and was its Treasurer and committee member in the 1990s. Prof. Pallot first visited the USSR as a post-graduate exchange student in 1979 and has been a frequent visitor ever since. In the late 1980s she spearheaded exchange agreements with geographers in Russia bringing many geographers who had never before left the USSR to Oxford under a British Council funded scheme. She has especially strong links with researchers in the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences and has had a ten year collaboration with Tatyana Nefedova, Russia's leading authority on Russian agriculture. She also collaborates with scholars in the Geography Departments of Moscow and Perm' State University, and the Peasant Studies Centre of the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences. In the past two years she has developed links with the Federal Penal Service in the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice negotiating a memorandum of understanding between Oxford University and the Academy of Law and Penal Management in Ryazan' which has led on to a collaborative research project. Prof. Pallot's current research interest lies in Russia's penal geography. She is the principal investigator for an ESRC funded project 'Space and Gender in Russia's Geography of Punishment'. The project, which due to the sensitivities of working with the Russian penal bureaucracy was in gestation for two years, formally began in November 2006. Her co-researchers are Dr Laura Piacentini a criminologist from the University of Strathclyde, and the geographer and former postgraduate of the School of Geography and the Environment, Dr Dominique Moran, from the University of Birmingham. The project involves collaboration with a newly constituted research group within the Academy of Law and Penal Management in Ryazan'. Seed money for this project was obtained from the University of Oxford Research Development Fund (\u00a320,000) which paid for a pilot study in L'govo juvenile girls colony in March 2006. This was followed in April 2007 by field work in three women's penal colonies in the republic of Mordovia. In December further fieldwork is scheduled in penal colonies in Perm' krai. Prof. Pallot has already presented early findings from these studies at the University of Toronto (Conference 'What it Soviet Now?' in 2006) and the RGS/IBG September 2007. In conjunction with the research on women's experiences of the Russian penal system, Prof. Pallot has applied for funding (Nuffield and Guggenheim) to employ Dr Elena Katz to work with her on extending the research of women's experiences of penal Russia to include prison visitors. Prof. Pallot has an established reputation in the field of Russian 'peasant studies'. Her early work focused on the responses of the Russian peasantry to the reform initiatives of the late Imperial government (particularly, the Stolypin Land Reform) and the struggle for common property rights in the Soviet period. In the 1990s she extended this interest to post-Soviet period, to examine rural adaptations and household food production during the transformation to a market economy. The Leverhulme funded project with Tatyana Nefedova involved field work in seven regions and more than thirty rural districts located in contrasting regions (including Moscow, Perm', Archangel, Ryazan', Samara and Saratov oblasts and Stavropol' krai). The results of this research have been published in a variety of English and Russian language journals and in two books. Research is on going with research trips planned for Kostroma and Mordovia in 2007 and 2008. In August 2007 Prof. Pallot was involved in a film project for the Russian TV station Kul'tura on the history of Russian farming in a global context. The results will be broadcast as a 14 part series in November and December 2007.

He has taught at the Universities of Toronto and Liverpool, where he was, until 1981, Reader in Geography and Latin American Studies. He has carried out numerous field investigations in Mexico and the Caribbean and published 12 books and more than 100 research papers and chapters. Professor Clarke has been Chairman of the Society for Caribbean Studies (and a Life Member since 2004); President of the European Association for Research on Central America and the Caribbean (Life President since 1988); and Chairman of the Society for Latin American Studies. Between 1998 and 2002 he led a research project entitled 'Decolonizating the Colonial City: Kingston, Jamaica, 1940-1991' (funded by the Leverhulme Trust). He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1999, and in 2003 was lifted up by Sri Chinmoi to mark his contribution to human development issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2004 he was awarded the degree of At Oxford he has been Tutor for Admissions at Jesus College, Chairman of the Faculty Board of Anthropology and Geography, Chairman of the Inter-Faculty Committee for Latin American Studies, and Head of the School of Geography and the Environment. Professor Clarke's research interests include urbanization in developing countries; race, ethnicity and class; peasantries; and the problems of small, recently de-colonized states. His regions of specialization are the Caribbean, Latin America and, more recently, Central Europe. Although he is a geographer, his research interests overlap with social anthropology, sociology and history. Since he completed his book on Mexico in 2000, Professor Clarke has concentrated on the Caribbean, and in 2006 published two books on Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, in which he examined the process of urbanization and the structure of colour-class stratification and cultural pluralism over more than three centuries. More recently he has turned his attention to Trinidad, and is currently preparing for publication an ethnographic journal he kept jointly with Gillian, his wife, focusing on race, religion and politics in San Fernando and the neighbouring Naparimas. Based on research carried out in the second year of Trinidad's independence (1964), the journal takes the reader into the very heart of a plural society, newly freed from colonialism. Professor Clarke is currently engaged in a new project, entitled 'Racist Regimes', the aim of which is to compare Caribbean slavery with the Jewish Holocaust in Europe. This research is not about slavery in the USA, where slaves were a minority of the labour force, and labour-intensive sugar was not the major export crop; nor is it about the full range of victims of the Holocaust, the inclusion of whom would render the research less manageable. Its focus is the Caribbean, especially the British colony of Jamaica, where the harsh, tropical, sugar-plantation regime involved the labouring to death of slaves of African origin; and the Holocaust, which involved both labouring to death and outright mass murder perpetrated on Jews by Nazi Germans in the occupied territories of Central Europe. The objectives are to produce a systematic comparison between slavery in the Caribbean and the Holocaust in Central Europe; to show how the theory of differential incorporation informs race laws and exclusion from citizen's rights; to draw out the commonalities between slavery and the Holocaust; to identify the differences between the two regimes/systems; and, through the comparison, to achieve a profounder understanding of each racist regime. Holocaust survivor/writer Primo Levi (2004) commented in the Afterword to : 'in every part of the world, wherever you begin by denying the fundamental liberties of mankind, and equality among people, you move toward the concentration camp system, and it is a road on which it is difficult to halt' (390-1).

Prior to joining the School of Geography and the Environment in 2008, Paul worked at the University of Reading as Professor and Director of the Aquatic Environments Research Centre. His research interests have focused on dynamic behaviour of river, lakes, wetlands and catchments and the interactions between hydrology, water quality and ecology. He has developed the suite of dynamic models which have been applied widely across the world in many countries and in all continents. His research has been funded by the UK Government ( , the EU in 5 framework research programmes from 1982 to the present, Water companies and other industrial partners. He also contributes to the Professor Whitehead has served on several senior NERC committees such as the Thematic Programme Planning committees for the River Ecology Programme (NERC \u00a38 million), Pollution Pathways Programme (NERC \u00a38million), Land Use Research Programme (NERC \u00a312 million), Joint NERC/ Programme (\u00a336 million) and Environmental Diagnostics (NERC \u00a36million). He has also been an environmental research advisor to the EU, European Governments and . He has also worked in Nepal, Thailand, India, China, Taiwan, Brazil, Australia and the USA. He has published widely with over 90 papers in the refereed literature as well as being guest speaker at a wide range of conferences and meetings. Paul's research is focused on the interplay between environmental management of major problems such as climate change and pollution control and the development and application of new mathematical techniques for modelling environmental systems in the past, the present and into the future. Predicting the behaviour of water quality and ecosystems in rivers, lakes and wetlands is a crucial element of modern environmental management. Water resources and ecosystem health are key issues for EU and Government Policy especially to address Directives such as the Water Framework Directive and to assess the potential impacts of climate change. Paul is currently on the executive committee of the which is Europe's largest research project addressing the impacts of climate change on river, lake and wetland systems across Europe. As part of the project Paul has been developing a new range of models for modelling river catchments to simulate the behaviour of water flow and quality, as well as the behaviour of ecological parameters such as biomass of macrophytes, epiphytes and phytoplankton in streams. These models have been applied widely across Europe and provide a powerful set of tools for evaluating processes controlling water quality and ecosystems behaviour. Providing a potable source of water for peoples across the world is a crucial goal for sustainable development. Without a sound supply of high quality water peoples lives are blighted and most means of expanding economic and personal well being are severely limited. Paul's research aims to utilise his knowledge and expertise to work towards sustainable management in many countries around the world. Past projects have included studies in Jordon, Nepal, China and Brazil to assess man-made and natural pollution and to determine the best means to minimise problems and maximise the availability of water to communities. There are significant lessons to learn from the past and the application of modern hydrological and modeling techniques to evaluate past civilisations is a fascinating area of research. Paul has been involved in a key Leverhulme Project on and this has recently involved studies in Jordan to assess the hydrology and populations levels of the ancient city of Jawa and a study of the Dead Sea to evaluate past, present and potential future water levels.

She is interested in these processes and dynamics over a range of timescale and applies techniques to address questions about whether groundwater aquifers are part of the active hydrological cycle and questions about the timing and forcing mechanisms of expanding and contracting Quaternary drylands. Abi is currently working with Prof. Mike Edmunds and Prof. David Thomas, using pore-moisture in sand dune sediments in the Stampriet Basin, in the Kalahari in order to: reconstruct rates of recharge to unconfined groundwater; to understand the production and origin of nitrate in groundwater and produce a palaeomoisture history from the vertical profiles. She is currently developing this research theme following her pilot study undertaken during her Thesiger-Oman International Fellowship from the Royal Geographical Society. Abi continues to conduct research into the Quaternary palaeoenvironments of dryland areas, with a focus on the Namibian portion of the southern African subcontinent. Currently, this involves luminescence dating of dune material in the Namib Sand Sea and reviewing the palaeoenvironmental and geomorphological history of that region. She aims to test the applicability of pore-moisture techniques to the large Namib Sand Sea dunes, in order to provide a palaeomoisture proxy. She undertook her thesis on the reconstruction of Quaternary environmental conditions in Namibia using terrestrial proxies at the School of Geography and the Environment, holds an in Geography from Oxford. She was previously employed within Prof. Heather Viles' Rock Breakdown Laboratory where she coordinated write-up of an English Heritage funded soft capping research project. Abi is a teaching fellow in physical geography at St John's College, having held previous teaching posts at Keble and Christchurch Colleges and undertaken sabbatical cover teaching at Worcester and St Hilda's Colleges and tutorials for St Catherines College and St Edmund Hall. She also delivers physical geography practical classes as part of the FHS Geographical Research paper and is a tutor for the Quaternary Science and Desert Landscapes and Dynamics optional FHS subjects. The two broad themes of Abi's research involve using chemical tracers in the pore moisture of surface sediments and the reconstruction of Quaternary landscape dynamics. This research develops the use of chemical tracers in the pore moisture of near-surface sediments with the aim of improving understanding of dyland hydrological dynamics over both decadal-to-century and century-to-millennial timescales. Abi is fortunate to be working with to provide vital scientific data on recharge behaviour and rates to enable those within policy to design effective planning for sustainable use of groundwater supplies. as novel palaeoclimate proxy for late Holocene moisture fluctuations in drylands, where traditional proxies relating to moisture are not preserved. This pilot research, funded by the Thesiger-Oman fellowship, BSG small grant and the Fell Fund, tests the application of chloride mass balance (CMB) methods to assess rates of recharge to groundwater through the linear dunes of the southern Kalahari. This research centres on the Stampriet Artesia Basin, a key transboundary groundwater resource in Namibia, Botwsana and South Africa. Results from two test sites in Namibia indicate high suitability, suggest recharge rates are between 7 and 56 mm/y and that sampled dune profiles span multi-decadal timescales. Rainfall over the 2011-2012 rainy season is being analysed to better constrain the chloride input into the sediments. There is now a need to constrain spatial variability across the basin and produce a regional estimate of recharge via this direct mechanism through dune sands, which cover 80% of the basin surface. This is particularly important for the uppermost aquifer layer, from which the majority of groundwater abstraction occurs. Future sampling is planned. Sampling dunes in the southern Kalahari for dual moisture and OSL analysis, in a region where pumped groundwater is key to agricultural development. The provision of a moisture proxy using CMB methods in sand-covered regions, such as the vast Namib Sand Sea will be invaluable to answering questions about long term hydrological and environmental dynamics in the southern African subcontinent, which lies at the interface of tropical, subtropical and temperate atmospheric and oceanic circulation systems. It has been suggested there is some coherence in records of progressive aridification over the past few thousand years, but, not all proxy records are in accordance, and the spatial complexity of the environmental response can only be addressed by widening the coverage of sites into regions such as the Namib Sand Sea, about which very little is known over this timescale. Recent notable success in applying the CMB approach to provide information over centennial-to-millennial timescales has been had in the Badain Jaran Desert in China by other researchers. Further development of this novel proxy is of great significance in refining our understanding of environmental change in dryland regions, which are hampered by a paucity of preserved proxy records that relate directly to moisture availability. Sampling is planned later this year. Abi plans to develop these methods in other dyland regions with a potential collaboration with Prof. Ashok Singhvi in India. This represents part of the effort within the Landscape Dynamics research cluster to better understand long-term landscape dynamics using field and laboratory methods. This builds on research undertaken during Abi's DPhil that utilised sand dune, interdune water-lain sediments and fluvial tufa and applied OSL and U-series dating. The application of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) in the Namib Desert continues to revolutionise our knowledge of the past dynamics of this dryland environment. OSL has been applied to: (i) complex linear dunes, alongside ground penetrating radar stratigraphy, to establish dune migration rates; (ii) fluvial lithofacies associations, to constrain periods of higher discharge and (iii) aeolian sand, interbedded with carbonate deposits, to provide chronologies for water-lain and interdune sediments. Abi has been reviewing the contribution of these data to enhancing the understanding of palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrological change on the west coast of Namibia and also dune migration rates for complex linear dune features at the far northern extent of the northern Namib Sand Sea. This research investigates the age and characteristics of different dune features within the northern Namib. The Namib Desert is one of the earth's oldest deserts. Above the semi-consolidated, tertiary-aged Tsondab Sandstone, lies the Namib Sand Sea (the unconsolidated dunes). The sand sea contains a range of dune types, and some of the largest dune forms found on earth. There is a paucity of chronological control for the dunefield, although cosmogenic nuclide data have recently been used to suggest the region has remained covered in sand for at a million years and luminescence dating in the northern reaches indicates dynamic dune activity over the last five thousand years, with complete overturning of large dune features. This study aims to provide new chronological data in a region of 'dendritic' dune morphology. This morphology is particularly interesting as it contains features of different sizes and orientations that would appear to represent different generations of dunes. The preliminary results from four of the samples suggest that very recent aeolian activity is responsible for the formation of small features (a few metres high), whilst the large linear dunes (up to 100 m high) appear to substantially older than existing luminescence chronologies for the region. Abi teaches physical geography at St John's College, having held previous teaching posts at Keble and Christchurch Colleges and undertaken sabbatical cover teaching at Worcester and St Hilda's Colleges and tutorials for St Catherines College and St Edmund Hall.

His major contributions are to health policy and promotion, particularly in HIV and sexual health. Two significant examples are: needle exchange for injecting drug users (IDU); HIV prevention in men who have sex with men (MSM). After needs assessment which found high levels of sharing of drug injecting equipment amongst IDU he was instrumental in setting up, and then evaluating, the first dedicated needle-exchange in the UK and the roll-out of this harm reduction strategy in England and Wales using combined behavioural and biomarker data. This work has been cited internationally, helped with the adoption of harm minimisation globally, and contributed to reduced parenteral transmission of HIV throughout the world. His research on men who have sex with men is widely cited, and has informed HIV prevention strategies in the UK and internationally. He undertook the first community based survey of prevalent HIV using oral fluid antibody tests and the first UK evaluation of peer-education for risk reduction in MSM. He led work which first described in Scotland increased risk-behaviour after the introduction of HIV therapy in the mid-1990s, and subsequently specified the undiagnosed fraction of HIV in community-recruited MSM across the UK.

The purpose is to develop a more rigorous understanding of normative issues in geography, and in particular those associated with inequality and social injustice. The first phase involved a thorough exploration of literature in moral philosophy, in general and as it bears on (human) geographical inquiry. This has provided the foundation for papers discussing moral issues in development, the spatial scope of beneficence, and moral aspects of community, as well as reviews of work at the interface of geography and ethics which attempts to identify common ground. The work also explores other issues, such as the notion of 'moral geographies', the moral significance of boundaries and movement, entitlement to land and natural resources, and aspects of social justice. As well as being concerned with moral theory, the research involves case studies. These provide contextual understanding, or the 'thickening' of such 'thin' general concepts as rights and social justice. The cases explore moral issues in South Africa after apartheid, the changing 'moral landscape' of the east European city, and conflict over land and settlement in Israel/Palestine.

At present we focus primarily on the neural correlates of particular types of conscious content, aiming to distinguish between conscious and unconscious representations in the human brain. As a considerable amount is already known about the anatomy and physiology of the visual system, much of the research in the laboratory focuses on visual awareness. However, we are interested in all the major modalities and work in the laboratory also studies the auditory and somatosensory systems.

Co-PI Marta Rabikowska, University of East London This interdisciplinary study concerns the cultural production and transformation of health knowledge and practices in the context of international migration. Visual methodology (film and photo-elicitation) and participant observation were used to enhance understanding of how the negotiation and articulation of health knowledge and practices are mediated by and constitutive of place and to stimulate dialogue among academics, community organisations, policy makers and health care professionals around migrants\u2019 health needs. Participants were recruited from groups self-identifying as Polish, Nigerian and from the Indian diaspora. The primary output of the study was a film, as both a cultural product and educational tool (see public engagement section). : Promoting breast awareness and early presentation among Black women 25\u201350: a pilot survey and intervention study in City and Hackney : Promoting breast awareness and early presentation among Black women 25\u201350: a survey and intervention study in City and Hackney Researchers at Homerton Hospital noticed that while black women are less likely to develop breast cancer than their white counterparts, when they are diagnosed with breast cancer it tends to be at a younger age, typically before the age of entry into the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Black women also tend to be diagnosed with the more severe and aggressive types of breast cancer. Evidence suggests for various social and cultural reasons Black British women are less breast aware and less likely to seek help from medical professionals. In response to these issues Homerton Hospital commissioned a six-minute This study will trial the film, sending it out as a DVD to Black British female patients aged 25\u201350 in ten GP practices in the area of City and Hackney. We will compare the numbers of people consulting their doctors about breast symptoms and being referred for further investigation for suspected breast cancer before and after the DVD is distributed. We will also compare practices with the DVD with those yet to receive the DVD. In addition, we will conduct group interviews with women at the practices to gain their opinions of the DVD and to see if it has changed their awareness of breast cancer. A final one-day workshop will bring patients and medical professionals together to discuss the study\u2019s findings and decide how best to make use of the DVD.

He was awarded the 'Pioneer of the Nation' award at Buckingham Palace in 2003. His MD thesis on immunological and biochemical markers of disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) demonstrated for the first time active demyelination shown by the detection of breakdown products of myelin basic protein in the CSF in the absence of clinical symptoms. His post-doctorate research has been at the UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital, Queen Square, where he carried out the first serial MRI studies of the natural history of individual disease groups in MS, demonstrating the value of MRI in monitoring the disease process, and developed protocols used internationally for the use of MRI in assessing the effectiveness of new treatments. He has developed MR techniques which improve pathological specificity, and developed techniques for measuring spinal cord atrophy and cerebral atrophy (indicating axonal loss). He has identified the unique characteristics of the primary progressive MS group, and is a member of a group of international experts who defined diagnostic criteria for MS in 2001, 2005 and 2010. In 2013 he was part of an expert group which looked at phenotypes in multiple sclerosis and redefined the course of the disease.

Polyphase deformation at an oscillating ice margin following the Loch Lomond readvance, central Scotland, UK. Sedimentary Geology. Vol. 149(1-3). p 157-182. My research focuses upon the structural analysis of polydeformed glacigenic sedimentary sequences and the influence of subglacial processes on ice sheet dynamics and glacier motion. The primary aim of this research to aid our understanding of the processes involved during proglacial and subglacial deformation, and the role of meltwater in this high dynamic system. I am one of a few scientists worldwide who are employing micromorphology as a tool in evaluating the often complex array of structures developed in response glacier induced deformation, becoming one of a few experts worldwide in this branch of Quaternary geology/glaciology. Research topics covered have included: the role of melt water in the transportation of ice-rafted sediments; understanding the complex signatures imparted on glacial sediments in response to polyphase proglacial, ice marginal and subglacial deformation; subglacial processes and glacier bed deformation, and its control on the forward motion of glaciers and ice sheets; bedrock controls on subglacial landform distribution; and the role of glacitectonism in subglacial landform development. Recently I have expanded my scientific research into the field of structural glaciology, examining the internal 3D structural architecture of glaciers and how this relates to subglacial and ice-marginal processes (e.g. subglacial landform development), and the forward motion of these ice masses.

I undertook my PhD with Professor Robin Carrell FRS in the Department of Haematology at the University of Cambridge. My work demonstrated that the Z mutation of \u03b11-antitrypsin caused the protein to undergo a novel conformational transition and form chains of polymers that are retained within hepatocytes. It is these polymers that underlie the PAS positive inclusions that characterise the condition. I showed that this same process was important in the retention of the Siiyama, Mmalton, S and I variants of \u03b11-antitrypsin that also cause hepatic inclusions and plasma deficiency. My research team expressed, purified, characterised and crystallised wildtype and mutants of \u03b11-antitrypsin and developed monoclonal antibodies and cell based assays to elucidate the pathway by which polymers form in vitro and in vivo. We also assessed a variety of strategies to block polymerisation that included the use of chaperones, competition with blocking peptides, in silico screens for small molecules that bind to novel allosteric pockets that we identified in our crystal structures, and more recently stem cell technology. The process of polymerisation is not unique to \u03b11-antitrypsin but occurs in other members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Mutants of \u03b11-antichymotrypsin, antithrombin, C1-inhibitor and heparin co-factor II were described by my team, and by others, that form polymers in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with emphysema, thrombosis and angiodema respectively. Perhaps most striking was our description of this process in neuroserpin to form inclusions within neurones and an autosomal dominant dementia that we named familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies or FENIB. In view of the common mechanism linking all these diseases we have grouped them together as a new class of disorder that we have termed the serpinopathies. We have used our understanding of the serpinopathies to provide insights into other conformational diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and the prion encephalopathies. The recognition that point mutations in neuroserpin underlie the dementia FENIB led us to assess the role of this protein in the more common dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. We were able to demonstrate that neuroserpin is present in the plaques of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, that it forms a one-to-one interaction with the A\u03b2 peptide and that it reduces the toxicity of this peptide in vitro and in a Drosophila model of disease. Our Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease showed striking neurodegeneration and we therefore used it for a genetic screen to identify modifiers of the toxicity mediated by the A\u03b2 peptide. Our data show a clear role for oxidative stress in neurodegeneration. Moreover we have collaborated with Chris Dobson's group (Chemistry, Cambridge) to use this model to develop algorithms of peptide toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only genetic factor that is widely accepted to predispose to COPD. The identification of novel genetic factors will provide new insights into the pathobiology of this disease. I have therefore worked with Ed Silverman (Harvard) to establish the International COPD Genetics Network that was funded by GSK. This network was used to demonstrate independent familial aggregation of the airway and emphysema components of COPD and to assess candidate genes in association studies. It has recently been used in GWAS to identify SNPs in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) and FAM13A as being associated with COPD.

In My teaching draws on my empirically-based research on rivers and, through my work in river restoration, students are introduced to current policy and practice in river restoration. Classes are interactive with frequent opportunities for discussion and debate, and site visits to restoration schemes allow students to gain first-hand knowledge of restoration design and develop an appreciation of the challenges and benefits of restoring rivers.

Many rivers contain aquatic plants growing in the centre of the channel (submerged) and at the margins (emergent) and they act as important ecosystem engineers, modifying flow patterns and the processes of sediment deposition, entrainment and transport (Cotton ., 2006). Invertebrates (such as blackfly larvae) that live on these plants modify sediment properties, resulting in organic-rich and highly-aggregated fine sediments (Wharton (NER/T/S/2001/00932: Fine sediment and nutrient dynamics of lowland permeable streams: establishing the significance of biotic processes for sediment modification). Because contaminants such as fertilisers and pesticides adsorb to fine sediments and the nutrient-rich sediments within the aquatic plants release methane (Sanders The Environment Agency is using these findings, including a knowledge of the sediment habitats associated with different plants (Wharton et al., 2006; Clarke and Wharton, 2001) to develop and refine a software tool called LEAFPACS. The tool helps in the assessment of a river\u2019s ecological status by predicting what plants should be present and comparing this to actual observations. Another important issue in lowland vegetated rivers is weed cutting, routinely carried out for flood risk management. Current research is being conducted on the River Lambourn (Adam Sutcliffe, CEH NERC Studentship) to measure and model the detailed flow hydraulics following different weed cutting strategies to inform management decisions about the optimum levels of aquatic plant cover. In recent decades increased inputs of fine sediments to lowland rivers have resulted in the ingress of silts, clays and sands into gravels, excessive surficial deposits, and elevated levels of sediment-bound contaminants. Recent research in the Frome-Piddle Catchment, Dorset, (Robert Grabowksi QMUL PhD Studentship) in collaboration with Ian Droppo (Environment Canada) examined the spatial and temporal variations in the erodibility of fine sediment deposits, using a Cohesive Strength Meter (Grabowski ., 2012). And associated experimental flume work developed a calibration to allow CSM measurements taken in the field to be expressed as critical shear stress values to help further knowledge of entrainment thresholds for fine cohesive sediments (Grabowski ., 2011). Parallel research (Luke Warren NERC PhD Studentship; Grieg Davies NERC PhD Studentship) focused on quantifying how much fine sediment is transported in vegetated river reaches (Warren ., 2009) under seasonally changing vegetation cover and how much fine sediment is stored (Heppell et al., 2009).

In preparation for this trip, students carry out a critical literature review on a relevant topic. The students each produce a 2-page fact sheet and they then become the \u2018expert\u2019 on their topic holding a question and answer session at an appropriate location \u2013 it could be on a beach, in a boat or on the middle of a mangrove swamp! Much of my teaching, particularly at third year and masters level, has a strong emphasis on developing the skills that students need to progress into environmental careers. This teaching is informed strongly by my research. For example, in Environmental Management Applications students learn how to carry out ecosystem service assessments, and at 2 and masters level students collect environmental data (e.g. contaminants in soils, sediment and water) and write up their findings as technical consultancy style reports. (funded by Defra, in collaboration with Queen Mary, School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, the Natural History Museum and Adas) Pollution from non-coal abandoned metal mines is a serious impediment to rivers and estuaries in England Wales meeting their water quality targets as set out by the EU Water Framework Directive. Recent work has identified the mines that are most likely to be causing a significant environmental impact and hence where efforts to prevent pollution will be focussed. However, what is not clear is to what extent rivers, and the animal and plant life they support, are impacted by the legacy of past pollution still bound up in river sediments and to what extent the problem is linked to metal-contaminated water currently entering rivers from mines and mine waste heaps. Work will be undertaken to clean up mine waters (removing or reducing toxic metals) before they enter the river but if sediments in the river and estuary beds are already contaminated and affecting life in rivers then the planned clean-up work of mine water sources may not result in the expected recovery of ecological condition. This project aims to improve our knowledge of the impact of metal-rich sediments upon river life and the potential they hold for inhibiting ecological recovery following remediation of mine water discharges. We will use new approaches to more directly measure the levels of toxic metals to which life in the water is actually exposed, and we will relate these values to the integrity of the whole community of animals in the river. This work will be supported by chemical analysis of the river and estuary sediments and laboratory experiments where we will manipulate environmental conditions and measure the response of the metals bound to the sediments and the contamination of animals living in the sediments. Historically we have disposed of our domestic waste in landfill sites in the coastal/estuarine zone that are now at, or near, to mean high water. With climate change and associated predictions of sea level rise, increasing frequency of storm surges and changes to precipitation and river discharge there is now a risk that this contaminated material may re-worked and released to river, estuarine and coastal environments. We are currently working to assess the extent of such contamination in southeast England, to predict the potential consequences of sea level rise on contaminant release, and to develop a risk assessment model and sustainable management plan for the Environment Agency. Hydrodynamic dredging, including techniques such as water injection dredging (WID), involves the injection of large volumes of water under low pressure into bottom sediment , breaking the cohesive forces that bind fine sediment and allowing sediment to move under the influence of gravity and/or tidal and river flows. This is an effective and economically attractive dredging technique, which has been widely used across Europe and the USA. However, since 2011 it has become a licensable activity under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 and there is now an urgent need to improve our understanding of the potential environmental impacts of this technique including understanding the release of contaminants to the water column and changes to contaminant behaviour in remobilized sediments and then to develop appropriate monitoring protocols. Managed realignment (MR), a widespread coastal restoration technique, is increasingly being across Europe and the USA to re-create coastal salt marsh habitats and to deliver sustainable coastal defence. However, MR also has the potential to deliver many additional ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and water purification (through e.g. contaminant storage or denitrification). Our research has shown how understanding past land use and changes to soil structure can influence hydrology and solute transport in restored salt marsh sediments with potential consequences for the ecosystem services that these restoration schemes can deliver (European Commission 2012; Spencer et al. 2008; Spencer and Harvey 2012).

I am a member of the , was elected to the Academy of Social Sciences in 2007, and received the Royal Geographical Society\u2019s Gill Memorial Award in 2003.

My teaching is informed centrally by my research interests and I am fortunate in being able to teach modules which are close to my core interests. As a consequence, students are provided with up-to-date and informed modules, reflecting some of the critical issues of political-economy and economic geography in the contemporary world. My approach to teaching is to always try to embed an understanding of theoretical and conceptual issues in the context of empirical cases, and as a result, much of my teaching focuses on globalisation and uneven development in the geographical contexts in which I research (West and East Europe, and North Africa). \"His knowledge and public speaking skills are the best things about the module. The handouts and enthusiasm are extremely helpful and inspiring\" For the past fifteen years or so I have been working on a variety of projects looking at the economic and social geographies of post-socialist transformation in Central Europe. This work has engaged with debates over political-economic transformation and development theory and tries to understand the contemporary geographies of economic (in)security. I also direct the at Queen Mary, which uses global production networks frameworks to understand the internationalisation of economic activity in the clothing sector and its implications for places and peoples around the world, with a specific focus on Central and Eastern Europe, and more recently North Africa and the former Soviet Union. This ESRC-funded research examines the effects of the European Union\u2019s approach to trade and sustainable development in \u2018third countries\u2019 and the extent to which this approach provides for meaningful improvement in working conditions in the global economy. It involves collaboration with colleagues in the Schools of Business and Management (Liam Campling) and of Geography (Mirela Barbu) at QMUL, and at the University of Warwick (James Harrison (Law) and Ben Richardson (Politics and International Studies)). The 2011 popular revolts in North Africa challenged long-standing authoritarianism and occurred in part due to the unequal outcomes (high unemployment and social/regional inequality) arising from the combination of state-led development strategies and nearly 20 years of economic liberalisation and integration with the European and international economies. This British Academy-funded research investigates the developmental implications of the uneven integration of North African economies into the European Union\u2019s (EU) economic sphere of influence. The research focuses on the extent to which enhanced integration into the European and world economies is able to resolve the economic insecurities which have dominated the experience of uneven development in Tunisia. It investigates the forms of integration through global production networks in the clothing and electrical equipment engineering sectors, which are the dominant export-oriented industries in the country. I have been involved in research which examines the uneven integration and development of economic interactions between the \u2018new\u2019 Europe (meaning the enlarged European Union) and its neighbours. This research focused on the forms of integration through global production networks of economies in the former Soviet Union and North Africa with the market and trade relations and associated governance frameworks of the European Union. It did so, in part, by looking at production networks involving clothing exports, which built upon my long-standing interest in the East European garment industry and the growth of outward processing, global contracting and new trade regimes. Recent research has been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and involved collaborative work research with colleagues in the USA including John Pickles (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Bob Begg (Indiana University of Pennsylvania), Gary Gereffi (Duke University), Meenu Tewari (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), and in Central and Eastern Europe including Milan Bu\u010dek and Rudolf P\u00e1stor (University of Economics, Bratislava) and Poli Roukova (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences). We have been examining the dramatic growth of the garment industry in Eastern Europe, its restructuring under increasing competitive pressure as a result of trade liberalisation, and have been trying to understand these dynamics in relation to both the new geographies of trade liberalisation as well as the social and cultural embeddedness of industrial economies. This area of research built upon earlier ESRC-funded research examining territorial uneven development and economic transformations across Europe. This project involved research with Mick Dunford (University of Sussex), Jane Hardy (University of Hertfordshire), Ray Hudson (University of Durham), Al Rainnie (Curtin Business School) and David Sadler (Queen Mary University of London). The aim of this project was to link an understanding of territorial uneven development with the reconfiguration of economic sectors and divisions of labour in a Europe undergoing rapid integration after the collapse of state socialism. I also conduct research on household economic practices and social reproduction in Central European cities. Funded initially by the Nuffield Foundation, and more recently by the ESRC, this research has examined forms of domestic food production and networks of reciprocity and social cohesion amongst households in cities in Slovakia and Poland and has involved collaborative work with Alison Stenning (Newcastle University). A book arising from this research has recently been published: A related area of interest has involved collaborative work on the cultures of commodity economies. Most recently this has resulted in a special issue of The research on household economic practices and social reproduction has also linked to conceptual interests related to understanding neo-liberalism. This has resulted in the publication recently of an edited collection , funded by the British Academy, involved an examination of the globalisation and restructuring of metropolitan manufacturing in London\u2019s garment sector. Investigating the scope and scale of restructuring, the kinds of restructuring strategies established and the role of institutional structures and practices this project built upon my other interests in the global garment industry.

My belief is that people learn best in a supportive environment which offers a variety of opportunities to develop skills and understanding. Consequently my teaching frequently extends well-beyond the classroom and the traditional format of the lecture. Teaching modules on London provides the opportunity to explore the city on foot or to visit and work with my friends and colleagues in various London museums. Fieldwork is central to my teaching and for many years I have enjoyed taking first year undergraduate students to the North East of England to explore local landscapes and engage with a range of people to better understand how that region has experienced profound economic and social change. A new initiative is an undergraduate module, developed in conjunction with colleagues, examining the historical geography of the fascinating North American city of Boston, which culminates in a week-long visit to that city. I am also an enthusiast of new learning technologies, developing a range of on-line resources to help support students\u2019 learning and incorporating social media into my teaching. I have been nominated for teaching prizes on several occasions and won the College\u2019s Drapers\u2019 Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2003. I have also led three small teaching and learning projects on developing students\u2019 quantitative research skills, enhancing their employability through building relationships with alumni, and designing a new overseas field work module. For over a decade, I have also taught a course on nineteenth and twentieth Century London for the University of California London Fall Programme and currently co-teach this with the brilliant London historian and writer . I also lead occasional walks or give lectures on London\u2019s history and geography for a range of other North American universities.

With Martin Daunton (University of Cambridge) and David Green (King\u2019s College London) and Postdoctoral Research Assistants Sam Shave and Lesley Hoskins (University of Cambridge). This project explores the social, economic and political significance of inheritance for middle-class families in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Britain. It builds earlier work on this theme (also, in part, with David Green). Through a series of detailed empirical studies, our research has explored themes such as the intergenerational transmission of resources and the role of women in generating and passing on wealth. At a conceptual level, we have characterised such transfers as a form of middle-class \u2018wealth-fare\u2019 provision thereby seeking to widen the historiography of welfare beyond narrow concerns with emergent social policy and the origins of the welfare state \u2013 largely directed at support for the poor \u2013 to the wider regimes of assistance and provision that sustained people\u2019s everyday lives. The current project will develop some of these arguments and will eventually lead to a book exploring the importance of inheritance and family property transmission for understanding social inequality and intergenerational well-being and justice.

April 2015\u2013September 2015. With Rupert Featherby (Museum of London Archaeology) and three undergraduate and one postgraduate student at Queen Mary. This project, in conjunction with colleagues at Museum of London Archaeology, aims to investigate the value of archaeological collections in revealing the spread and influence of Asian goods within the early modern metropolis. The East India Company supplied the British with a variety of new and exotic products from South Asia and beyond, shaping tastes and consumption habits in distinct and lasting ways. While we know a good deal about how such goods were consumed by elite households, we know less about their popularity and diffusion among the less wealthy, something that archaeological evidence promises to yield insights into. The project will employ 3 student researchers, and a postgraduate supervisor on a short term basic basis to work on the Museum of London\u2019s collections and on the India Office records at the British Library.

For the last three centuries the East End of London has been regarded as a place of settlement for people who are newly arrived to Britain. This project reverses this usual perspective by considering the East End as a place where individuals and institutions contemplated and prepared for leaving Britain for a life overseas. Specifically, it focuses on the work of Thomas Barnardo\u2019s Ragged Schools and Children\u2019s Homes in Stepney, where in the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century children departed Britain for the colonies, particularly Canada. The project will explore the charity\u2019s migration policies within its own institutional goals and Barnardo\u2019s evangelical and ideological visions and will examine how children were prepared both emotionally and physically for this social upheaval and made aware of their imperial lives ahead.

With Catherine Nash (PI), Alison Blunt and Postdoctoral Research Assistant Caron Lipman (all at Queen Mary, University of London) This project focuses on the meanings, knowledges, practices and material dimensions of living with the past at home. It considers the significance of people's awareness of previous inhabitants of their home, or that which is deemed to be inherited from them, in framing domestic belonging, ownership, and aesthetic expression in the home, and the forms of historical knowledge and historical practice that are prompted, informed by and result from this awareness.

Inspired by the long history of strong communities and innovative civic engagement in London\u2019s East End, the aim of this pilot research project is to examine the ways that companies are engaging with communities in the contemporary East End. The study focuses on companies based at Canary Wharf, examining the nature of contemporary corporate philanthropy, community engagement and CSR activities. As well as mapping the range of activities taking place, the project seeks to understand how company strategies are shaped by understandings of East London as a place of need and as a site for benevolence , as well as how they seeking to respond to current political-economic imperatives.

Working with colleagues in Australia (Martin Shanahan, University of South Australia), New Zealand (Jim McAloon, Victoria University of Wellington) Canada (Livio di Matteo, Lakehead University) and Britain (David Green, King\u2019s College London), the research explores the significance of the financial opportunities, political structures and institutional mechanisms provided by the British empire in shaping the accumulation of wealth in different territories.

This major project explored how individuals responded to the expansion of financial markets and new opportunities for investment in Britain and its empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were two main strands to the study: the first involved the use of death duty records to analyse the composition of personal wealth portfolios; the second entailed a large scale study of shareholdings to examine the range and nature of personal investment practices.

I have been conducting research on this topic since the mid-1970s, and have contributed a wide range of new knowledge on the influence of aquatic and riparian plants at plant, landform and reach scales. This research has demonstrated: How changes in the vigour and growth rates of riparian trees are associated with changes in river channel style and morphology, even in rivers up to 1km wide (Bertoldi et al., 2011). How aquatic plants can be the main control on bed morphology and lateral channel migration in low gradient lowland rivers. (Gurnell, 2013) How plants induce the development of characteristic \u2018pioneer\u2019 landforms in rivers of different size and planform, creating an important interface between the river channel and its margins (Gurnell et al., 2012) How plant propagules are dispersed in a similar way to sediment in fluvial systems, being deposited and retaining their viability in intermediate stores on the river bed and banks, and showing broad differences in their deposition sites according to species. (Gurnell et al., 2007, 2008) Engineering works constrain the morphological characteristics of urban rivers, whereas their flow, water quality and sediment transport regimes are constrained by their river network setting. Over the last decade, I have worked with several research students and assistants to develop a set of tools to characterise and assess the biophysical properties of urban river reaches and to place such assessments into their river basin context. This research has: Analysed the data generated by the surveys to identify interpretable gradients in the biophysical structure of urban rivers (Gurnell et al., 2012). The urban river survey (URS) methodology, the data collected using the technique, and maps of quality scores derived from the surveys can be viewed at the following website: Research on themes (1) and (2) is directly relevant to river restoration. I have conducted projects that have (a) evaluated interactions between naturally-colonising vegetation and the morphodynamics of a newly-cut river channel and (b) have monitored the response of rivers to interventions by implementing pre- and post- project assessments, particularly on urban water courses. These have all provided insights into the degree to which rivers are able to self-restore and, when active restoration is necessary, interventions can be small, aiming to activate self-restoration. Where such approaches are possible, they are extremely cost effective and can quickly generate morphologically diverse outcomes.

This interest has been developed in a series of independent or collaborative projects investigating the changing nature, politics and sensibility of work and transnational migration to global cities like London and exploring how and why \u2018new\u2019 migrants have come to dominate low-paid work here ( ); the everyday financial practices of new migrant communities which are partly shaped by exclusion from the financial fabric of London but also a preference for alternative ways of \u2018doing finance\u2019 ( ). Some of the key debates and findings of these bodies of work have been developed in the following recent publications: .; McIlwaine, C.J., May, J.; Herbert, J.; Evans, Y. and Wills, J.

Negotiating care and caring among migrant workers in London\u2019s low pay economy, I teach development geography across the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes as part of a distinctive, innovative and collaborative \u2018hybrid geography\u2019 agenda which encourages students to challenge the positioning of the global South as a collection of places in need of external development interventions; to recognise the immense diversity of the global South and the links between the global South and North. This agenda is particularly developed in the two undergraduate modules which I co-teach: The latter is the first development geography overseas field class to be offered at the School of Geography at QMUL. \u201cObviously the trip was fantastic, seeing the elements of the city come to life was really good and helpful. But also the teaching and content throughout was really good.\u201d ( This collaborative research aims to document Muslim migrants\u2019 philanthropic networks in London in a post-recessionary context. Rejecting the presumption that \u2018the economy\u2019 can and should be theorised solely from the perspective of the formal spaces of western economies, this research seeks to learn from \u2018alternative\u2019 models of Islamic philanthropy in order to \u2018theorise back\u2019 from different economic spaces, institutions and practices, and to explore their geographical (re)configuration in the UK context. It investigates the sources, motivations and everyday practices of migrant charitable giving which underpin larger-scale Islamic charitable financial flows through London via a case study of the Somali community living in London\u2019s East End. Pilot research has been funded by The Centre for the Study of Migration & School of Geography at QMUL and CURDS, University of Newcastle (\u00a34149). This project examined the diverse everyday financial practices adopted by new migrant communities in London within the context of financial exclusion. It investigated the extent and levels of financial exclusion among migrant communities from core financial services; the legal and illegal strategies which migrants devised to access these services as well as the informal and alternative financial practices that they engaged in, particularly in relation to accessing credit. The research identified the key barriers that new migrant communities face in integrating into the financial fabric of the city which inter-relate with immigration status, labour market position and transnational financial practices; and the mechanisms by which financial exclusion among migrant men and women can be addressed. This research formed the basis of a book, (Policy Press, Bristol and University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2012), and contributed to public policy debates in the UK through as series of events organised by HM Treasury\u2019s Financial Inclusion Taskforce including invited talks to the Taskforce, a Treasury-DFID Conference and a presentation at a Parliamentary launch at Westminster on Irregular Migrants. The research was funded by the Friends Provident Foundation, ESRC-CASE, London Citizens and the School of Geography, QMUL (\u00a3118 794). My interest in transnational migration was particularly developed through this collaborative project which examined the changing nature of the labour market and transnational migration to the global city of London. It examined a range of processes behind the formation of a distinct \u2018migrant division of labour\u2019 which led to the dominance of migrant labour in low paid work while also focusing upon the lives of migrants in London as well as their transnational connections. It highlighted the essential contribution that low-paid migrant workers make to the functioning of the city and how this role is often overlooked. This research was extensively disseminated to academic and public policy audiences and formed the basis for an important collaborative book entitled (Pluto Press, London).

The former work illustrates the principle of borrowing strength (via Bayesian methods) to make life expectancy estimates for small areas, when conventional estimates may be subject to instability. The latter study, funded by GRO Scotland, investigated possible alternatives to Census based population estimates (known as the SAPE estimates) for 6505 Scotland datazones, using administrative datasets with comprehensive population coverage such as the NHSCR and DWP customer populations. Health care profiles for US micro areas (Census 2000 and 2010 Zip Code Tracts) have been developed in collaboration with the National Minority Quality Forum ( ).

I am past editor of My undergraduate and Masters level teaching is directly informed by my research, and I have written and co-edited the key texts for a number of modules. I jointly teach a first year module on \u2018Critical human geographies,\u2019 which introduces students to the ways in which attempts to change the world have shaped the discipline of geography. My lectures focus on humanistic geography, feminism, geographies of sexuality and postcolonialism, and all include time for class discussion. I am co-author (with Jane Wills) of the key text for this module, My third year module on \u2018Geographies of Home\u2019 explores home on scales from the domestic to the global. It focuses on questions such as: why is identity often shaped by a sense of home? How and why is the home an important site and subject for creative work in literature and the visual arts? Why are nations often described as \u2018homelands\u2019? How do experiences of home change with transnational migration? Drawing on historical and contemporary examples, and a range of personal and academic accounts, the module also includes a visit to The Geffrye Museum of the Home and opportunities for creative coursework. I am co-author (with Robyn Dowling) of the key text for this module, I also enjoy teaching on MA Cities and Cultures, and teach a new module with Catherine Nash on \u2018Cultural Geography in Practice.\u2019 This module explores creative, collaborative and curatorial practices in cultural geography. My part of the module focuses on home and diaspora through seminar discussions and visits to The Geffrye Museum of the Home and the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers). Together with other colleagues (including Jon May, Miles Ogborn and David Pinder in Geography at Queen Mary), I have co-edited a book used on this and other modules: 'Alison is a fantastic and enthusiastic lecturer \u2013 she really engages with you as an individual, whilst teaching the class as a whole' (Geographies of Home). Although ideas and lived experiences of diaspora are intrinsically transnational, a wide range of research invokes the nation through material and imaginative connections to a past, present or imagined \u2018homeland.\u2019 Other research focuses on the city as a site of diasporic resettlement, exploring the contested terrains of multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism. Focusing on four communities from Calcutta (Anglo-Indian, Brahmo, Chinese and Jewish), this research investigates the importance of the city rather than the nation in shaping, recasting and articulating diasporic identities, and studies diaspora cities as places of origin and resettlement. This research was funded by The Leverhulme Trust from 2007-10, with the research team consisting of myself as Principal Investigator, Noah Hysler-Rubin and Shompa Lahiri (postdoctoral research fellows) and Jayani Bonnerjee (PhD student). See This project seeks to understand people\u2019s attitudes to and understandings of the history of their homes. It involves interviews with a range of British householders to discover how their knowledge of the past of their homes informs the choices they make in living in them. These choices might relate, for example, to the material furnishing and designing of different home spaces as well as more generally to perceptions of and feelings about the past. The focus includes what has been \u2018inherited\u2019 from previous inhabitants \u2013 materially, aesthetically and in terms of stories that might have been passed on or uncovered. The research is funded by the AHRC and is in collaboration with The Geffrye Museum of the Home. Catherine Nash is Principal Investigator, with Caron Lipman as postdoctoral research fellow and Alastair Owens and myself as Co-Invesigators. The project has included workshops at the Geffrye and will conclude with an exhibition there opening in September 2013. My research in this field has two main directions: first, historical research on settlement houses in London and New York, which developed from my involvement with the British Academy funded international network on \u2018The Urban Atlantic.\u2019 This research includes a study of new ways of urban dwelling promoted by Christodora House \u2013 the \u2018skyscraper settlement\u2019 - in New York City. Second, I am Co-Investigator on a pilot project funded by the Centre for Public Engagement at Queen Mary on \u2018Mapping corporate philanthropy and community engagement in East London.\u2019 Focusing on companies based at Canary Wharf, this project seeks to identify the ways that corporations engage with communities in the East End of London through various types of corporate social responsibility and philanthropic initiatives. The research team also includes Cathy McIlwaine as PI, Alastair Owens and Jane Wills as CIs and Johanna Wadsley as postdoctoral research fellow. Together with Cathy McIlwaine, Jayani Bonnerjee and Cliff Pereira (community engagement facilitator) and working in partnership with the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) and The Geffrye Museum of the Home, this AHRC research review explored the idea of \u2018connected communities\u2019 in relation to diaspora and transnationality across the humanities and social sciences. It developed the idea of \u2018connectivity\u2019 within and across communities that are transnational and diasporic.

I am PI on The Child in the World project, a five-year collaboration between Queen Mary and the V&A Museum of Childhood (MoC) focused on researching the lived experiences of London children between 1870 and the present day. The research is being undertaken by three PhD students working on distinct Collaborative Doctoral Awards (CDAs). They are supervised by staff in the School of Geography and the School of Languages, Linguistics and Film at Queen Mary, and by staff at the V&A Museum of Childhood. The students are also working across the two institutions to produce a series of joint publications and activities.

LWPF convenes up to three seminars a year at QMUL for academics and practitioners working on women and the built environment. Everyone involved in the built environment world tries to meet the needs of their clients. Child-sized furniture is designed for nurseries, disabled parking bays are located next to entrances, sheltered housing sites are planned near post offices and shops. However people are often unaware of the needs of a majority of the population; women. With the introduction of the UK Gender Equality Duty there is now a legal obligation to consider those needs. Funded by UrbanBuzz, and in partnership with the Women\u2019s Design Service, this project (with Wendy Davis as PI, myself as CI and Clare Melhuish as postdoctoral research fellow) aims to raise the profile of gender issues in the built environment.

My cross-disciplinary interests stem from a somewhat roving educational background: BSc in Biology and Geography (Carleton University, Canada), MSc in Earth Science (Waterloo University, Canada) and PhD in Ecology (University of London, UK). My research interests focus on biogeochemical cycling and spatiotemporal dynamics, in both cases with empirical work concentrated mainly (but not exclusively) on peatlands. My research seeks to answer some key questions: How do internal processes and external drivers such as climate change interact to control ecosystem dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales? , Nilsson, M.B., De Ruiter, P.C., and Wassen, M.J. 2010. Resource contrast in patterned peatlands increases along a climatic gradient. Over the past few years, I have taught on several undergraduate and postgraduate modules. Currently, I teach on the following: Peatlands have potential for strong feedback on the global climate system, but their response to future climate change is highly uncertain. Rather than gradual change, peatlands show long periods of little change, punctuated by abrupt transitions of state even under weak or steady environmental forcing. In ongoing research, my aim is to understand the ecohydrological feedbacks that control the non-linear behaviour of these systems. Field-based and modelling studies focus on the interactions among hydrological processes, organic matter dynamics, and energy exchanges. A key theme focusses on the role of spatial heterogeneity and surface patterning in mediating these interactions. One of the biggest challenges facing conservation organisations is to adapt to climate change in a way that balances habitat conservation and provision of ecosystem services. Low-lying areas of the Broads are subject to increasing flooding and saline influence owing to sea-level rise. These environmental changes are likely to alter greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration, as well as habitats. The overarching aim of this project is to deliver the new knowledge and decision-support tools required by conservation land managers in the Broads to adapt effectively to sea-level rise, i.e., to maintain or increase the amount of carbon sequestered and minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, without compromising the central conservation value of managed lands. Funding: NERC Open CASE studentship, with the Broads Authority. Lowland peatlands that have been subject to human disturbance and inappropriate land management can release large quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but direct measurements of greenhouse gas emissions from these systems are sparse. This project, led by the University of Leeds, will provide the first full carbon and greenhouse gas budgets for lowland peats across England and Wales. Results will be used to develop 'emission factors' for each peat type under a range of management activities. The results should improve the evidence base on which national policymakers and local land-managers make decisions on the management of lowland peats, allowing them to balance the role of peatlands in regulating greenhouse gas emissions against the many other ecosystem services they provide.

My research is inter-disciplinary and not only has influenced environmental change management in the UK and overseas but has also contributed significantly to the international scientific literature. In the UK I have contributed to the recognition of the widespread problem of freshwater acidification that arose in the 1980s. Research is on-going but the main body of research led to the recognition that atmospheric deposition of acid pollution from fossil fuel energy generation as the principal cause. In North Africa my research undertaken as part of the CASSARINA and MELMARINA projects led to the Tunisian Government\u2019s site descriptions of Ghar El Melh and Megene Chitane being listing as internationally important sites under the Ramsar Convention. During the course of my overseas research I have provided training for environmental scientists and management practitioners in partner organizations that has enhanced their capacity to manage inland waters. This has included hydro-ecological monitoring programme design and operation for environmental scientists in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. In Canada, my research (with C. Curtis) in the tar sands region lead to the realization that the tar sands oil extract methods were not causing widespread water acidification. IN Lake Baikal my studies of diatoms and recent environmental change indicated that water quality of this immense lake was not severely impaired by pollution in the 1990s.", "tag": "peer"},

I am interested in the modernization of the built environment, in \u2018new spaces\u2019 in cities, and also in new ways of seeing the city. I am also keen to promote a degree of methodological eclecticism, combining a variety of quantitative and qualitative, archival and literary approaches. Thematically, my archival research has been principally concerned with the development, ownership, management, occupancy and experience of new residential forms, including middle-class apartment buildings and working-class model dwellings in London and Toronto in the period 1880-1939. , which will combine analysis of quantifiable records \u2013 building permits, directories, assessment records, property deeds, probate returns \u2013 which reveal who owned and who lived in apartments, and how the market in apartment property operated, with case studies of planning controversies reported in newspaper articles, council minutes and correspondence, and also with study of the representation of apartment life in contemporary novels, guide books and advertising. Research on London uses similar methods, but focuses as much on the construction and representation of \u2018model dwellings\u2019 as on luxury apartments. My chapters in Black and Butlin (eds) (2006) illustrate my methodological approach in the context of blocks of mansion flats and model dwellings which featured prominently both in architectural discourse about living in flats and in George Gissing\u2019s novels of London life such as Most recently, my historical housing interests have concentrated on each extreme in the social hierarchy of nineteenth-century London \u2013 in London\u2019s first high-rise luxury flats that foreshadow more recent enthusiasm for penthouses and loft-living, and in the common lodging-houses associated with Jack the Ripper\u2019s victims in 1880s Whitechapel.

He was included in Who\u2019s Who for the first time in 2009 and was granted a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award for the study of early human evolution in East Africa in 2011. Humans are rather weak when compared with many other animals. We are not particular fast and have no natural weapons. Yet Homo sapiens currently number nearly 7.5 billion and are set to rise to nearly 10 billion by the middle of this century. We have influenced almost every part of the Earth system and as a consequence are changing the global environmental and evolutionary trajectory of the Earth. So how did we become the worlds apex predator and take over the planet? Fundamental to our success is our intelligence, not only individually but more importantly collectively. But why did evolution favour the brainy ape? Given the calorific cost of running our large brains, not to mention the difficulties posed for childbirth, this bizarre adaptation must have given our ancestors a considerable advantage. In this book Mark Maslin brings together the latest insights from hominin fossils and combines them with evidence of the changing landscape of the East African Rift Valley to show how all these factors led to selection pressures that favoured our ultrasocial brains. Astronomy, geology, climate, and landscape all had a part to play in making East Africa the cradle of humanity and allowing us to dominate the planet. this book offers far more than a palaeoanthropological cocktail with a twist ... In synthesising the most recent research in palaeoanthropology and giving the ecology of our ancestors a climatological twist, Maslin has produced a book that is fascinating, humbling and informative. Understanding the emergence of our species from the unique landscapes of East Africa is one of the great scientific challenges. Mark Maslin takes us on an exhilarating intellectual journey, encompassing geology, astronomy, climate science and evolutionary biology, to argue that the unique landscape and ever-changing climate of the East African Rift Valley were instrumental in catalysing the emergence of a civilisation on our planet. I'm left with a dizzying feeling of our good fortune to be here at all, and a powerful sense of our responsibility, as Maslin notes, to earn our species name: \"Wise\". There is an amazing amount of information packed into this surprisingly slim book ... Maslin is able to quickly fill us in with the basic information on highly complex global processes we need to know, before continually returning us to the core theme of how this led to who we are today. Snazzy graphics \u2013 diagrams and graphs \u2013 helps break up the flow of information being directed our way, and aide smooth digestion. Maslin applies his own mind to existing theories and creates a hybridised narrative, one based on the mix of local, regional, continental and planetary changes which have affected East Africa over millions of years. He powerfully illustrates why nexus thinking of geography\u2019s broad disciplines is so key to fully understanding such an immense subject as the evolution of humanity \u2013 the story of us. In this tale of mountains, monsoons and meteorites, climate and ocean currents, Maslin masterfully puts human evolution into context, and shows how the earth and its environments have shaped us. A powerful, gripping account of how the dynamic earth shaped human evolution\u2026 with impressive ease, Maslin packs a tremendous amount of knowledge into a flowing narrative, making the point that special ontinent eventually turned out to be our luck...A tour de force through Earth\u2019s history and a timely reminder of just how lucky we are to be here at all. Palaeoclimatologist Mark Maslin delves into deep time to trace humanity\u2019s rise to geological hegemony. Examining early hominin finds in East Africa, he spotlights three stages (bipedalism in Australophithecus, a jump in brain size in Homo erectus and Homo sapiens\u2019 arrival some 195,000 years ago) and the roles of climate change, celestial mechanics and plate tectonics in their emergence. Ultimately, he theorizes that \u2018climate pulses\u2019 in the Rift Valley, in which hyper-arid conditions alternated with the formation of vast lakes, helped to drive the evolution of the big hominin brain.

This was a complex project that sought to build research capacity in Botswana, whilst undertaking geographically challenging fieldwork. Our biological, chemical and hydrological data fed directly into the Okavango Delta Information System database, used by all planning and implementation agencies involved in the . Capacity building was central to our project. We provided extensive training in environmental modelling and quantitative data analysis to colleagues both employed on the project and those employed by the Botswana government and Okavango Delta stakeholders. A particularly successful outcome of the project has been subsequent employment of three technical staff gaining permanent full-time employment with the University of Botswana, and the employment of the MPhil student ( ) on the project securing a teaching job at the newly created Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST).

Whilst on fieldwork we were also filmed by national Russian news channel Rossiya 24, which was aired on 9th March 2013 - What can the Quaternary record tell us about the stability, resilience and sensitivity of landscape systems and the services they provide , an agenda-setting workshop which brought together leading academics, stakeholders, funding bodies and graduate students to focus on identifying some of the most pressing questions facing the discipline of palaeoecology today and into the near future. Ideas in Geography is an introduction to the history and philosophy of the discipline. Why does this matter? Because ideas develop in particular times and places; because they change, are forgotten and sometimes rediscovered; and because ideas have consequences \u2013 not just for academics but for the rest of the world as well. \u2022 to introduce students to some of the key themes, debates and developments which have shaped the modern discipline of geography; \u2022 to explore some of the main tensions in the discipline between, for example, physical and human geography and between traditional approaches and more recent developments; \u2022 to show how changes in the discipline of geography are related to wider social, cultural, economic, scientific and historical developments; \u2022 to enable students to develop their own ideas about geography as a discipline and to understand the diversity of different approaches used in geographical research. The course aims to provide students with an introduction to the concepts and techniques useful for studying the nature of past environmental change since the last glacial period to the Holocene. The following topics are covered: (i) a range of natural archives of environmental change (e.g. lake and marine sediments, ice cores); (ii) chronological techniques used to date these archives; (iii) biological indicators used to reconstruct past environmental change; (iv) palaeoclimatic and human-impact case studies. The course has also been designed to give practical experience in the identification of biological indicators. The range of discipline-specific skills developed through a geographical education should normally include statistical analyses. This ensures that students and researchers gain the necessary knowledge to develop a deeper understanding of scientific papers read, and research projects carried out. This course ensures students: The primary aim is to investigate topical environmental themes (important to the well-being of our planet) within the context of a long-term perspective (using palaeoscience approaches). A secondary aim is to encourage students to publicly participate in the themes developed on the course by the creation and maintenance of a weblog (\u2018blog\u2019) site which counts towards 50% of the assessment. The MSc Conservation at UCL is widely recognised as the leading course for aspiring nature conservation professionals. This highly successful degree programme saw its first students graduate in 1960, and nearly 80% of its graduates have gone on to secure posts related to conservation. The MSc Conservation is strongly interdisciplinary and engages with environmental, social and policy dimensions. It has a vocational orientation, with residential field-classes providing first-hand experience of practical conservation challenges. The programme is unique not only on account of its long history and the resulting extent of its alumni network, but also due to the active involvement of nature conservation professionals in the delivery of course material. There is a pressing national and international need to understand the nature and consequences of climatic change and to develop adaptation strategies. The UCL Climate Change MSc provides rigorous scientific and vocational training for the next generation of climate change professionals. Students will acquire knowledge and understanding of the Earth System (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, lithosphere) and the nature and causes of climate variability and change.

He holds an equivalent position at the University of Leeds. Simon was a Royal Society University Research Fellow (2004-2013), and in 2011 received a Philip Leverhulme Prize recognising the international impact of his research. In 2014 he was listed as one of the world\u2019s most highly cited scientists in the Environment/Ecology field (see highlycited.com). He gained a PhD from the University of Cambridge studying in the Department of Plant Sciences. Simon is a plant ecologist by training with a central focus on the tropics and global environmental change including climate change. His primary interest is in how humans are changing the Earth as a system. This is because one of the key issues facing humanity in the 21 century will be to address how a population of at least 8 billion can lead fulfilled lives without breaching environmental thresholds that may cause serious social, economic and environmental disruption, or even more severe outcomes. The more specific focus of his research is to gain a synthetic understanding of the recent, current, and likely future compositional and functional trajectory of the tropical forest biome. That is, to understand how and why tropical forests are composed of the tree species that form these forests, understand their important functions, such as how much carbon they store and cycle, and understand how these systems are changing due to local, regional and global environmental changes, and ultimately how they may change in the future. Dr Lewis\u2019 research on tropical forests and climate change has been covered by newspapers, TV and radio worldwide, including the BBC, CNN and the Professor Lewis\u2019 research intersects several policy relevant areas, including tropical forests and their deforestation and degradation, climate change, biodiversity conservation, the prospects for indigenous peoples, rural poverty, and the global trade systems for products from tropical lands. Therefore, he is involved in both public understanding of science activities, such as writing newspaper commentary and giving public talks, and engages with policy makers. For example, Simon hit the headlines following a successful campaign to have a misleading article in the Sunday Times removed at the height of the poor reporting of climate change-related science following the collapse of the 2009 Copenhagen international negotiations and the release of some climate scientists emails (aka \u2018climategate\u2019). On the policy side, Simon assisted drafting of Inter-Academies Panel (IAP) statement on tropical forests and climate change released to coincide with the Copenhagen UN conference on climate change. IAP is a group of 103 national academies of science, including all the G20 countries. Simon has been interviewed on the BBC\u2019s Today program several times, and occasionally contributes science-policy commentary pieces to the Simon has supervised or co-supervised nine successful PhD students, and currently supervises a further six students (three in Leeds). He has 31 successful grant applications from his PhD onwards that funded his PhD, post-doc and fellowship positions, obtained from ten funders including the National Environment Research Council, Royal Society, Leverhulme Trust, Government of Gabon, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, David and Lucile Packard Foundation. He has published 12 book chapters, 3 major databases and 90 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals, including in Professor Lewis founded and co-ordinates the only African network of on-the-ground tropical forests monitoring plots where individual trees are tagged and monitored over time, called AfriTRON (African Tropical Rainforest Observation Network). This requires extensive fieldwork in very remote locations. AfriTRON currently spans 10 countries across tropical Africa, and with its sister network in South America (RAINFOR) consists of >500 locations and >300,000 trees being monitored.

The long-term project collects and collates collates long-term phytodemographic data to better understand the commonalities and differences amongst the three major tropical continents, Latin America, Africa and SE Asia, with a major focus on Amazonia, the Congo Basin and Borneo. Currently funded by the EU FP7 GEOCARBON program, A project to quantify the impacts of differing management techniques to restore degraded lands to increase carbon storage and biodiversity. We ask: the such interventions worth the investment, or is merely waiting for nature restore itself enough? Includes fieldwork in Uganda and Malaysia, led by PhD student Charlotte Wheeler, and funded by NERC and Permian Global. This project was designed to discover and quantify the extent of peat underlying the swamp forest of the cuvette centrale of the Congo Basin, understand how the system functions and how much carbon the system stores. Consisted of several field campaigns to central Congo, led by Leeds PhD student Greta Dargie. Forthcoming papers likely soon. Funded by NERC, Wildlife Conservation Society and a Phillip Leverhulme Prize. See: I am assisting the government of Gabon in designing and implementing a national forest and carbon monitoring program, in collaboration with Duke University and University of California-Los Angeles. See: There is some controversy about both remotely sensed data for monitoring tropical forest and the carbon they store (as satellite data is an indirect estimate of forest biomass and carbon), and ground-based inventory plot measurements (as they are generally at a very low sampling density, if we are concerned about making inferences over large spatial scales, and are also an indirect estimate of forest biomass and carbon). My view is that combining both techniques is essential to providing the most accurate measurements of tropical forest biomass and carbon storage.

Benchmark map of forest carbon stocks in tropical regions across three continents. I have been collecting and analysing, for physical and chemical characteristic, soil from as many of the long-term forest inventory plots as possible, to begin improving our understanding of soil physical and chemical factors on forest growth, dynamics and carbon balance. An early paper utilising this data showed that after accounting for soil fertility Asian forests were considerably more productive (in terms of aboveground wood production) than Amazonian forests (Banin et al. 2014). I have been developing a new research program on the Anthropocene, the idea that human activity has altered the Earth System so dramatically they we are now the major driver of in the Earth System today, and so we have entered a new geological epoch, termed the time of humans, the Anthropocene. First papers on this should be published in 2015, and new PhD student beginning research on this topic shortly. My research includes major contributions to networks of long-term tropical forest inventory plots, which now constitute a pan-tropical on-the-ground observatory of tropical forests. This is an international networks of scientists (from >50 institutions, >250 participants and >30 nations) using standardised methods developed, honed and propagated across the tropics. This enables, for the first time, the use of on-the-ground observations to make a direct evaluation of the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle and to assess their sensitivity to climate change (Lewis et al. 2009; ). As well as having a major impact on international debates on the future trajectory of climate change and appropriate policy responses, this work is influencing national-scale efforts across the tropics to monitor forests in the face of climate change and to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation. Various research impacts are summarised below. Dr Lewis founded and co-manages a network of long-term inventory plots across 12 countries in tropical Africa (Lewis et al. 2013, ). This network has contributed to forest management in Gabon, for which Dr Lewis was a technical advisor to the government of Gabon, at the UN climate change talks in 2009 (Copenhagen), 2010 (Cancun), and contributed data to [The National Climate Plan] of Gabon. Additionally, Lewis acted as a technical advisor to the government of Gabon at the Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC) to discuss how carbon storage and carbon fluxes in the Congo Basin should be monitored. Currently, Lewis alongside John Poulsen (Duke University) and Sassan Saatchi (NASA Jet Propulsion Lab, UCLA) are assisting the government of Gabon in a national forest monitoring program. Dr Lewis was also an external consultant for Centre for International Forestry planning phase of the pan-tropical USD100 million \u2018Sentinal Landscapes\u2019 program. : This is a global repository for long-term forest inventory data, co-founded with Prof Oliver Phillips, Dr Tim Baker and Dr Gabriela Lopez-Gonzalez (all University of Leeds). Extracted data has been used in >50 publications, resulting in >1000 articles across print, TV and radio worldwide. Contained within the foresplots.net database is the global wood density database, co-created by Lewis (led by Amy Zanne, George Washington University), itself the most downloaded dataset on the datadryad repository. (ground monitoring) measurements, with atmospheric measurements and models to monitor the emissions of carbon from human activity, with the stores and fluxes of carbon in the atmosphere and across the world\u2019s land surface and oceans to give a comprehensive understanding of the global carbon cycle and how humans have perturbed it. The AfriTRON plot network contributes to GEOCARBON. This EU funded Euro8.8million project is a precursor to an operational global monitoring system. While it is the job of society generally to determine policy positions, politicians to formally define agreed rules, and citizens and the judiciary to hold politicians to account, scientists can contribute to societal debates via timely information to assist the public in their decisions. Dr Lewis has contributed to this, for example, back in 2005 the UK government distributed a paper of his on tropical forests and avoiding dangerous climate change to other countries at the UN climate talks in Montreal (published as Lewis et al. 2006, in , Edited by Schellnhuber et al.). In 2009, Dr Lewis contributed to drafting the InterAcademies Panel (the global network of science academies) on tropical forests and climate change ( ). More recently he published a short piece in response to the UN Rio+20 conference on some of the difficulties of deciding on and implementing planetary boundaries (Lewis 2012 ). Dr Lewis also spend a week in the European Parliament shadowing an MEP (Linda McAvan) to learn about how policy-makers do their work. Dr Lewis serves on the Conservation Committee of the Association for Tropical Biodiversity and Conservation, the world\u2019s largest scientific society focusing on tropical biodiversity. The committee releases timely reports to assist choices when specific policies, projects or activities may negatively impact biodiversity and the people who directly rely on it. : Dr Lewis is regularly asked for comment on climate change, tropical forests, and scientific research more generally.

There are a large number of researchers at UCL working on biodiversity-related topics, across Geography, the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research (CBER), the Environment Institute, Earth Sciences, Anthropology, the Energy Institute, Archaeology, Genetics, Evolution and Environment (GEE) and others. The Biodiversity Forum and Seminar Series is a chance to talk across departments and faculty, to foster greater collaboration (particularly now the NERC DTP is funded which can facilitate cross-departmental PhD projects). November, and meets on the third Tuesday of every Month, at 4pm, room 432, No. 16 Taviston Road (fourth floor, UCL School of Slavonic Studies building), or occasionally other nearby rooms within the same building. The Forum is intended for post-docs and staff as well as masters and PhD students who have an interest in biodiversity, very broadly defined, from discovering new species to policy impacts on biodiversity, and spanning the past, present and future of biodiversity. Usually there will be three speakers, each giving 10-15 minute presentations around a broad theme. Most months have only two people booked so far, so if you would like to speak, please email Dr Simon Lewis (Geography, Refreshments provided. The idea is that having the forum at 4pm means those who have to leave at 5pm can, but those that want to chat, can continue. , Sonke, B., Sunderland, T., Begne, S.K., Lopez-Gonzalez, van der Heijden, G.M., \u2026.Zemagho, L.

The main focus of my research is monitoring vegetation using Earth Observation methods. I have built a focus, in my own work and that of my research group, around developing and applying new methods in this area, with a key emphasis on moving the field from loose empirical correlations to making use of physically-based models. I have always sought to develop a strong, rigorous, capability in modelling within my own work and that of my group (research as well as training elements such as the MSc remote sensing). This has led to a wide range of fruitful collaborations over the years. The approach has provided practical solutions to operational monitoring (e.g. my work over the last 10+ years leading to the development of the NASA MODIS BRDF/albedo product with colleagues at BU , and UCL) as well as providing for greater accuracy in spinoff applications such as model-based burn scar detection in Africa/change detection with colleagues at UMD /NASA. Gaining a NERC EOSI Lectureship in the last few years (Dr Paul Saich, a microwave EO modeller) has allowed for rapid progress in the area of examining common links between information in the optical and microwave domains. Exploring and exploiting this synergy forms previous joint work for ESA and BNSC (in collaboration with BAE systems), as well as a focus for future developments in the NERC Centre of Excellence and other areas. The basic approach of (robust) physically-based modelling developed has, and will continue to form a large component of my research focus. This has mainly been associated with developing models for 3D radiative transfer, of which our current model, is an expression. This model has been applied to a wide range of canopy types, initially with the aim of developing a testbed simulation system, from which can be developed an understanding of the main factors affecting shortwave radiation scattering and absorption. We have participated with this model in model intercomparison exercises within the international framework of The main directions of this work in the near future are (i) developing an understanding of the temporal dynamics of the radiation signal and synergy between optical and microwave scattered radiation through with ESA/BNSC/NERC funding; (ii) developing 'lumped parameter' models which encapsulate our understqanding of 3D scattering but which are able to accurately describe the radiation scattered with a small number of compound terms (see below); (iii) developing rapid methods for the inversion of physically-based models through sparse, compressed look-up tables (LUTs); (iv) developing system simulation tools to explore the possibilites of new sensor types and configurations. All of the streams of research in fundamental modelling are leading to the conclusion that whilst, in many ways, the remote sensing signal is a complex function of the details of canopy spatial arrangement and spectral properties, a decoupling of the structural and spectral aspects of scattering can provide significant insights into how a robust but simple model of radiation scattering and absorption can be constructed. Early evidence along these lines led to the development of so-called semi-empirical linear kernel-driven BRDF models which we helped developed and test and which form the basis of the NASA MODIS BRDF/albedo algorithm, a 16-day global 1 km product ( Schaaf et al., 2001). A spin-off application from these models has resulted in a set of 'signal tracking' models, one of which now forms the core of the NASA MODIS burned area detection algorithm. This product, which is soon to become operational, developed in collaboration with David Roy at UMD/NASA GSFC, allows the most accurate and robust mapping of burned areas so far developed (Roy , 2001, 2005). It has great potential for increasing our understanding of the impact of fire on Carbon budgets as well as in other areas (see fire below). Rebelo et al. (2005) show that semi-empirical signal tracking methods further developed from these models with an empirical temporal model allow for a more robust consideration of sudden changes in the reflectance signal, as well as more robust parameter mapping. Whilst these semi-empirical models have allowed for a range of practical applications, the model parameters associated with them have no direct physical meaning. The 3D modelling work undertaken within my group (developing from Lewis & Disney, 1998 in Lewis et al., 2005; Disney et al., 2005) is pointing to the conclusion that if we separate the 'structural' aspects of scattering from the 'spectral' we can build much more meaningful 'lumped parameter' models, from which we can provide mappings of biophysical parameters, as well as more directly linking radiation scattering and absorption. This latter point is of particular importance if we are to use such models to drive vegetation/ecosystem growth models. A core stream of research within the CTCD is to develop improved modelling and monitoring of photosynthesis from space. We are doing this in several ways, using both simple models of Gross Primary Production (GPP) such as the Production Efficiency Approach (which more easily links to satellite observations) and more complex mechanistic models. This is currently developing in two main areas: (i) allowing for satellite observation-based estimates of GPP to be compared with mechanistic model predictions (Quaife et al., 2005); and (ii) allowing for the assimilation of satellite observations into mechanistic models to improve predictive capabilities and show model inadequacies. We are currently attempting this latter approach by assimilating satellite-derived products such as MODIS LAI, but we are also developing towards more directly linking the mechanistic model predictions to the observations through an 'EO operator', essentially a canopy scattering and absorption model driven by the mechanistic model state variables. This will use what we have learnt about simple parameterisatiuons of canopy scattering models and will allow for a clearer tracking of the uncertainties involved (thence uncertainties in Carbon flux prediction). In addition, we are investigating new methods for measuring photosynthetic activity from space with methods ranging from simple band ratios (Photochemical Reflectance Index - PRI, which is linked to light-use efficiency through Xanthrophyll cycling), and more recently, passive detection of fluorescence. Fire plays a major role in many ecosystem dynamics and is a large, dynamic and uncertain element of global Carbon bugets. One way in which Carbon release is estimated is by monitoring the area burned each year and multiplying this by factors associated with fuel load and fire intensity to arrive at estimates of Carbon released. We have therefore been working for several years to provide improved estimates of burned area from satellite data, building on our modelling expertise. As noted above, this has led to the development of the MODIS burned area product. An alternative and independent method for estimating Carbon release from biomass burning has been developed by Wooster (KCL). We have recently set up collaborative links with Wooster to combine these efforts with our improved burned area estimates and fire modelling activities within CTCD. We will be seeking NERC QUEST funding to follow this up. I have supervised around 20 MSc dissertations at UCL, and am currently responsible for four PhD students, three of whom are funded by NERC. I currently have three post-doctoral Research Fellows working for me on various NERC projects. I am involved in reviewing NERC and NASA grant applications, the former as a member of the NERC peer-review college, as well as reviewing papers for various journals including: RSE, RSR, IEEE GRS, IJRS, and New Phytologist.

Extremely common in almost all freshwater and marine environments they are an excellent ecological indicator species sensitive to acidity, nutrients and salinity.

Modern communities are used by environmental scientists for monitoring water quality especially in relation to the problems of acidification and eutrophication.

Current research interests are wide ranging and cover the following: I am interested how we can use palaeolimnology to create a better understanding of how lake ecosystems may respond to future changes whether these are due to climate change or pollution. The key to this is a deep knowledge of how lakes have responded to climate change and pollution over a range of timescales, obtained in many cases by using a multi-proxy approach. Much of my recent work has been concerned with changes in The Arctic, a region which is already responding to anthropogenic warming and which is predicted to be impacted by enhanced warming this century. The Carbo-North project ( ) and the SPICE project provided scenarios of Arctic change under various warming projections which were presented to stakeholders in Town Meetings in Usinsk, Pechora and Naryan Mar, in the Komi Republic region. I am one of the few active palaeo researchers in Russia and was recently invited to a Department of Energy and Climate Change meeting in Moscow to discuss better collaborative links with Russia. I have been involved with several major palaeolimnological research programmes in the Arctic, I am currently a co-investigator on a NERC Arctic programme project (NERC-LAC) leading the Russian aspect of the research. Another key aspect has been the development of the use of palaeolimnology in conservation. Working with the RSPB at Loch Ruthwen in Scotland we established a link between past productivity of the lake and the population of the rare Slavonian Grebe; this has directly led to ongoing research in the Flow Country in Caithness, funded by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, examining whether a palaeolimnological approach can help to understand why populations of the Common Scoter have declined in the last 3 decades I remain a committed member of the International Diatom Society, having served as Secretary and now a committee member. I have taught diatoms to undergraduates, masters students, PhD students, including many overseas students, and professionals, running courses for the Environment Agency for example. Recently I have talked to sixth formers and the local Civic Society in Hertfordshire about climate change, hosted widening participation events for sixth formers at UCL and been involved with the Science Lates series at the Science Museum.

An assessment of the long term fate and environmental consequences of the oily cuttings pile beneath the Valhall Platform and a review of potential treatment/disposal options. My research is focused on marine ecosystem governance issues, with a particular focus on those raised by marine protected area and marine spatial planning initiatives as a means of achieving biodiversity and fisheries conservation objectives. It is both , bringing theoretical perspectives to real challenges, contributing to both theories and practices. In terms of environmental sociology, rather than adopting a structure or agency approach to analysing governance issues, my research adopts a . In terms of environmental governance, my research challenges the widely held view that people-focused (neo-institutional) and/or market-focused (neoliberal) approaches should be the focus of governance. My empirical work on marine ecosystem governance is premised on arguments that a combination of governance approaches is required, and that state-focused (neo-Hobbesian) approaches are also of critical importance. , employing empirical analyses of marine protected area and marine spatial planning governance case studies to support the argument that whilst both people and market-focused governance approaches are important, the state plays a key role in steering markets and people, and that the state\u2019s role is critically important if strategic conservation objectives and obligations are to be fulfilled and institutuional resilience to the potentially perturbing effects of driving forces is to be developed. explores questions relating to the effective and equitable governance of marine protected areas (MPAs) and options for addressing them. A key theme is that MPA governance needs to combine participative, legal and economic approaches. Building on ideas concerning the governance of common-pool resources, this research employs a more holistic and less prescriptive theoretical and empirical framework for analysing case studies on the governance of MPAs. This trans-disciplinary approach is aimed at supporting the development of MPA governance approaches that build social-ecological resilience through both institutional and biological diversity. This builds on the argument that diversity is the key to resilience, both of species in ecosystems and incentives in governance systems. This research originally involved 20 case studies from around the world, funded by UNEP, culminating in the publication of the book 21 further MPAG case studies around the world have been undertaken, 16 of which, along with 18 from the original 20 case studies (published in book), are being subject to a new multiple case study analysis of the governance of 34 MPAs for a forthcoming paper and special section; November 2009 - October 2013. Dr Peter Jones was part of this consortium of researchers around the EU that was awarded a \u20ac 6.6 million (UCL \u20ac 0.67 million) grant under the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme. Dr Jones led the overarching work programme on governance issues, that analysed different approaches to implementing marine spatial planning. The MESMA project involved 21 research organisations from 12 EU and related countries. The outputs of the Journal of Environmental Assessment, Policy and Management; Journal of Environmental Management; Journal of Environmental Planning and Management; Oryx; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; The Geographical Journal; The panel was asked to respond to a number of specific questions concerning marine protected areas (MPAs) and related UK policies. Peter emphasised that a more holistic focus on the integrity of MPA ecosystems is needed rather than the present reductive evidence-hungry focus on specific features, such as particular species, and their vulnerability to specific activities, and that no-take zones, where all fishing and other extractive activities is banned, must be implemented for effective ecosystem protection, covering, to start with, at least 10% of the UK\u2019s sea area. He also argued that effective protection must now begin to engage with the EC\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy for all MPAs beyond 6 nautical miles, otherwise Brexit paralysis could fatally stall the process for these offshore MPA designations and they will remain merely as ineffective \u2018paper parks\u2019. Overall, he concluded that the UK government should consider and present MPAs as opportunities that can yield benefits, not just as restrictions that represent costs. Coordinated governance stream of a recent international conference (7-9 March 2016, Rome) to support the achievement of a globally agreed target to conserve at least 10% of coastal & marine areas by 2020 ( .

These outputs aim to provide a \u201croad map\u201d for moving forward on achieving the 10% marine protection target, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This will help guide national governments, United Nations agencies and development donors in MPA projects around the world, promoting MPAs that are designated on the basis of the best available science, that are effectively and equitably governed, and that contribute to sustainable development and are financially sustainable. Peter was invited to give a - discusses the evolutionary links between MPAs & MSP, and argues that integrated-use MSP is becoming a competitor to ecosystem-based MSP, leading to the marginalisation of MPAs.

There are many side effects that are caused by the interface between environmental information and the public. In the process of trying to make sense of the public and environmental information, I\u2019ve explored many related areas. This include: \u2013 most environmental information have a spatial component, and therefore it is stored and managed in GIS. To understand how it is being produced and how to make it easier to use, I ventured into the area of HCI. My interest here is in using theories, approaches, and tools from HCI/UE in the service of building participatory mapping systems, or in sharing environmental information with the public. These techniques are also helpful in understanding and researching how environmental information is used. \u2013 I have an ongoing interest in considering the wider implications of geographical technologies: from GIS to GPS, to mobile phones and the way geographical information is evolving and used. I have been exploring the literature on philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, and public engagement in science and technology. These frameworks are helpful in considering the societal aspects of these technologies, as well as considering how interventions and new technologies should be developed. \u2013 participatory mapping is an important method that allows the public to create their own environmental information and use it. I have been working in this area on a range of scales \u2013 from small scale mapping with local residents who live near UCL in central London, to the analysis of OpenStreetMap contributions from across the world during the Haiti earthquake in 2010. The technologies that are developed within the ExCiteS groups are especially geared towards this area \u2013 for example the Sapelli application that is aimed at allowing illiterate participants to participate in environmental information production. Fundamental to this area is the integration of technology and social practices to ensure that participation in inclusionary and meaningful. \u2013 Citizen science opened up the possibilities for participants from all walks of life to participate in creating environmental information that is actionable and usable. I am interested in participatory forms of citizen science that include extended peer communities (as suggested by Funtowicz and Ravetz 1993), the citizen-led concept of scientific knowledge production (as suggested by Irwin 1995), and bottom-up activities that are inclusive and participatory. In particular, in ExCiteS we\u2019re developing a form of citizen science that is situated, bottom-up practice that takes into account local needs, practices and culture and works with broad networks of people to design and build new devices and knowledge creation processes that can transform the world. \u2013 the access and use of environmental information and its role in environmental decision making is linked to regulations, conventions, and policies. A common aspect of my reserach is the analysis of the policy landscape and understanding how the technical and societal aspects of producing and using information fit within wider organisational and governance systems. Since 2001, I have secured over \u00a313.5 million in research funding, from research councils, and the public, private and third sectors. Some of these projects include: \u2018 \u2013 Collaborative project with Natural History Museum of Brussels, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Waag Society, European Citizen Science Association, Medialab Prado, Kapelica Galery, Meritum Poland, Tekiu, Eutema, and Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve. It is aimed at increasing the awareness and participation in citizen science across Europe. , funded by EPSRC. Funding to develop an understanding engineering and participatory methods to reduce fire and earthquake impact on communities \u2019 \u2013 Collaborative project with Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, France; European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), United Nations Institute For Training And Research (UNITAR) and Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve, Switzerland; Imperial College and Gold Mobile Innovation Ltd, UK. Research and evaluation of on-line collaborative environments and software tools that stimulates creative learning in the context of Citizen Cyberscience and citizen science. The project ran from 2012-2015. \u2019. Collaborative project with the Fondazione ISI \u2013 Institute for Scientific Interchange, Italy; Sapienza Universit\u00e0 di Roma, Italy; Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany; and the Flemish Institute of Technological Research, Belgium to explore participatory sensing of urban environment and behaviour change. The project ran from 2011 to 2014. , funded by EPSRC and ESRC and focusing on a detailed study of four suburban town centres in London. The project ran from 2010 to 2013. , funded by EPSRC to encourage multi-disciplinary research at UCL, especially in the areas of engineering and the built environment. The project ran from 2008 to 2011. , funded by EPSRC and focusing on London\u2019s suburban town centres. The project is already influencing policy by being part of a policy review, carried out by URBED on behalf of the North West London strategic alliance. The project ran from 2006 to 2009. . The project focused on the development of longitudinal evaluation of their activities and was part of their strategic evaluation programme. The project ran from 2006 to 2008. aimed at mapping environmental change and development in London. The project combined both community development and participatory mapping, using a public mapping system to monitor local sustainability and local development plans. The project was carried out in collaboration with More details about my experience and various projects on which I have worked on in the past 20 years can be found on Over the past 20 years, I have contributed to wider societal and economic activities through consultancy, promoting social enterprise activities at UCL (and setting the first UCL owned social enterprise), and through contribution to policy. I have been involved in over 20 consultancy projects in the past 15 years, working on usability aspects of public GIS (with Wandsworth Council, Camden Police), geographic information management (with the MoD, Ordnance Survey, Argent King\u2019s Cross), and participatory mapping (London Sustainability Exchange, URBED). The most recent projects were with the World Bank-GFDRR on managing a study and report writing about VGI use in government; Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars writing a report about Citizen Science and policy; and with Client Earth adaptation of the Saepelli app to handle HTML files so it can be used to navigate legal documents about logging. a social enterprise that will support sustainable communities through online mapping, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and citizen science. Details of Mapping for Change activities are \u201c, and the work of ExCiteS have received coverage in Nature, Science, Le Monde, BBC Click and many other outlets. I was the course tutor of the University of London M.Sc. in GIScience from 2002 to 2006, again in 2010 and continue to teach on this and other programmes at UCL. Course material is published on the I have supervised 32 PhD students as a first and secondary superviser since 2003.

Environmental system modelling, with particular reference to numerical simulation of hydrodynamics and fine sediment transport, complex system models, and data-driven modelling. History and philosophy of the earth and environmental sciences, with particular reference to coastal geomorphology and the role of models for prediction and explanation. ). This evolved into an interest in geophysical fluid dynamics, and research projects on turbulence characteristics in unsteady tidal flows (French and Clifford 1992. Estuarine and Coastal Shelf Science; Clifford NJ, French JR and Hardisty J (Eds.) 1993. , Chichester, John Wiley, 360pp) and in gravel bedded-rivers. More recent work has been concerned with tidal and meteorological forcing of estuarine fine sediment dynamics and potential sensitivity to climate change (French et al. 2008. Work on environmental system modelling encompasses a broad range of methodologies. Numerical modelling ranges from aspatial mass balance modelling of tidal saltmarsh morphodynamics (French JR 2006. ) to high spatial resolution hydrodynamic models that are used to critically investigate estuarine flood defence and sediment dynamics problems (e.g. French JR 2008. ). A recent collaboration is with the School of Civil Engineering in La Coruna, Spain, which has led to work on the evaluation of a new finite volume model and its application to the hydrodynamics of the Crouch estuary, Essex, UK (Cea L, French JR, V\u00e1quez-Cend\u00f3n M 2006. ). We have also developed a new approach to incorporating bathymetric data uncertainty into shallow water models (Cea L and French JR 2012. ). At the same time, more qualitative mathematical approaches are used for the study of geomorphological system behaviour at larger temporal and spatial scales (e.g. Tyndall Centre-funded Coastal Simulator project; Defra-funded Estuary behavioural system simulator project; ESTSIM project; EA-funded Large-scale geomorphogical system behaviour project). In addition to several large hydrodynamic monitoring campaigns within UK estuaries (Suffolk, Essex), the Coastal and Estuarine Research Unit has also been involved in the development of new instrumentation for in situ measurement of complex suspended the size distribution of suspended particulates in coastal and estuarine waters (Benson T and French JR 2007. ). We were also early adopters of airborne LiDAR to provide high spatial resolution data on coastal change and bathymetry (French JR 2003. ). Recent projects include hydrodynamic assessments of the Crouch and Roach estuaries, Essex, UK (for EA); evaluation of the beneficial use of cohesive dredge material for foreshore recharge in the Orwell estuary, (for Harwich Haven Authority); investigation of the effectiveness of coastal saltmarshes in dissipating wave energy in front of sea defences (for EA, in collaboration with CCRU); and lead authorship of the DEFRA/EA UK Estuaries Research Programme \u2013 Phase 2 Science Plan. ) and the development of more sophisticated criteria for the evaluation of complex numerical models against observational data (French JR 2009. My work over the last decade or so has been strongly translational in nature and has influenced thinking within both national agencies and a wider engineering community regarding the challenges posed by climate change at the coast. I have helped shape UK flood and coastal defence policy through my membership of the Defra/EA Flood and Coastal Defence Technical Advisors Group from 2000 through to 2005 and involvement with other national committees, such as the UK Estuaries Advisory Group. I was lead author of the Defra/EA Estuaries Research Programme Phase 2 Science Plan, completed in 2002. This led to a five-year \u00a33.5M research programme that focused on new approaches to understanding and modelling of broad-scale estuary behavior and response to environmental change. I recently led UCL\u2019s contribution to the \u00a32.9M NERC-funded Integrated Coastal Sediment Systems (iCOASST) project. In addition to developing new numerical models to predict the morphological evolution of our estuaries and coasts over the coming decades to centuries, UCL has developed a new conceptual model (Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping) and with associated software tools that represent the interactions between estuaries, open coasts and the offshore zone more effectively than the coastal cell framework that has informed UK shoreline management since the early 1990s. This iCOASST work has the potential to feed directly into future generations of Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) and, more generally should lead to a step-change in our ability to predict and visualize how the coast is likely to evolve as sea-level and wave climate changes. I m currently working with colleagues in UCL Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering on a NERC Environmental Risks to Infrastructure Innovation Project, which is developing new methods for refining forecasts of extreme storm surge water levels at estuarine ports. I have undertaken extensive consultancy work, much of it in collaboration with Helene Burningham in the Coastal and Estuarine Research Unit. This has included evaluation of the appropriateness of flood defence setbacks or realignments as an adaptive strategy for mitigating the effects of sea-level in estuaries (clients: Environment Agency; Black & Veatch Ltd; KPAL); the dynamics of offshore tidal bank systems in the southern North Sea, including the implications for wind farm development (clients: Crown Estate, HR Wallingford/Fluor plc); and the beneficial use of cohesive dredging material to restore eroding estuarine shorelines (client: Harwich haven Authority/Environment Agency). I was an expert external reviewer for the IPCC 5th Assessment (Coasts and climate change section), and I was also an invited international expert participant in the Future of the US Gulf Coast Summit, held in New Orleans in 2006, in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster.

He was an interventional Cardiologist in the First Hospital of Peking Medical University and Fujian Medical University Quanzhou Hospital. In order to save more patients, in 2001 he decided to leave routine clinical practice and accepted NMRC Fellowship in National University of Singapore, to study stem cell and developmental biology in regenerative medicine. In 2006 he was a visiting Research Scientist in experimental cardiology at Utrecht Medical Centre, Netherlands, and in 2007 a Research Scientist at National University Medical Institute, Singapore. He joined the University of Hong Kong as Research Assistant Professor in 2008 and Assistant Professor in 2010. His research interests are in the differentiation of human stem cells into therapeutically useful cell types, which open up new strategies to rescue many incurable disorders in near future. Dr Q Lian\u2019s laboratory focuses on Stem Cell biology for Regenerative Medicine with an emphasis on heart, neural and metabolic diseases. The long-term goal of stem cell research is to translate human stem cell to impactful applications. To this end, Dr Lian\u2019s lab has established an integrative platform comprised of iPSC technologies, genomic editing approaches and animal genetics to uncover mechanisms of stem cell-based tissue repair. The following programs are the present priorities. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) for cardiovascular and neural disease modeling. These iPSC lines derived from clinical biopsies provide invaluable resources for understanding disease development, pathogenic mechanisms and for treatment. CRISPR/cas9 technology is also employed to precisely correct genetic mutations for a gain-of-loss functional understanding. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-modulated tissue repair and immunomodulation have been applied in clinical trials. Nevertheless, mechanisms of MSC-mediated tissue repair are not fully understood yet. Dr Lian\u2019s lab recently discovered that intercellular mitochondrial transfer of MSC is one of the novel mechanisms in tissue repair. Efforts to understand molecular bases governing mitochondrial transfer from MSC to damaged cells are on-going. Genetically-modified hematopoietic stem cell therapy for fatal metabolic disorders. Genetically-modified human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation provides unique stem cells sources to rescue some inherited metabolic disorders. Employing HSC and genetic technologies to treat mitochondrial defect or lysosomal defect-provoked neural and muscular dysfunction are being examined in preclinical studies.

We have performed comprehensive molecular profiling and integrative genomics studies on large series of gastric and colorectal cancers using next-generation sequencing, expression microarray, DNA SNP genotyping array and methylation array. Our study revealed the complex genomic landscape of gastric cancer and first identified many new gastric cancer driver genes. Examples include frequent mutation of ARID1A, a chromatic remodeling gene, in gastric cancers with MSI or EBV, and hotspot mutation of RHOA in diffuse type gastric cancer. Integative genomics analysis has also identified many novel gastric driver genes altered by DNA copy number changes, DNA hypermethylation or demethylation with corresponding change in gene expression. Our study of gene expression have revealed novel modules reflecting intrinsic properties of tumour and normal cells, tumour-stroma interaction, host immune response and pathways of stem cell regulation. This information have led to the identification of new tumour suppressor genes frequently silenced in gastrointestinal cancers, genes that can modify tumour aggressive behaviour and patient outcome, and genes that contribute to maintenance of stem cell niche. Our team has extensively characterized the genetic basis for the exceptionally high incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) in Hong Kong. We have uncovered the mutation spectrum of germline DNA mismatch repair gene, and revealed a founder mutation that is common in the Southern Chinese population which originated between 22 and 103 generations ago. We have described the first example of heritable germline methylation of MSH2 gene promoter as a cause of hereditary colon cancer, and uncovered a novel mechanism of methylation induction and gene silencing through abrogation of transcriptional termination signal in an upstream neighbouring gene named EPCAM (TACSTD1). These findings have resulted in incorporation of EPCAM deletion into the standard genetic diagnosis protocol for Lynch Syndrome worldwide. Our laboratory is now applying the research findings to patient care, by providing a charitable genetic diagnosis service including genetic testing and referral for prophylactic screening for early-onset or familial colorectal cancer patients and their families. We have also studied in depth the role of the BRAF mutation in colorectal cancers, and discovered an interesting relationship between the BRAF mutation and various pathways of colorectal carcinogenesis. The long term goal of my laboratory is to utilise genomics technology to identify novel pathways of carcinogenesis and hereditary predisposition for colorectal and gastric cancers, and to identify biomarkers for early detection, patient stratification, prognostication or drug targets.

(1996) On the intrinsic dimensionality of the BRDF: Implications for the retrieval of land surface biophysical properties, My research is more generally in the interactions of radiation (predominantly at optical wavelengths) with the land surface. In particular I am interested in how radiation interacts with vegetation, how we can model and understand this interaction and how we can exploit it to quantify and understand the terrestrial biosphere, particular relate to the carbon cycle - how plants take up and release carbon, naturally, in response to changing climate and under an increasing range of anthropogenic disturbances (eg fire, land use change, agriculture, deforestation and degradation etc). Satellites allow us large-scale but very indirect observations of surface biophysical properties, particularly the extent and dynamics of vegetation. Much of my research effort has been directed at new ways of exploiting observations of this sort to provide quantitative estimates of these things that are consistent with our understanding of climate carbon cycle models and observations. The image below sums up our aims - this shows an area of temperate rainforest on Fraser Island, Northern Queensland, Australia. The variety of structure (shadows, texture) and variations in leaf colour (to do with chlorophyll and water content) is very striking. My aim is to understand and exploit this 'signal' much better than we can do currently, for all sorts of applications that rely on knowing the state of forests like this. over the last few years, as they give us an unprecedented level of detail with which to model radiation interacting with the surface - and this is our satellite signal. Faster, cheaper computers mean we can use these models in ways we never could even a few years ago. I have worked with modelling software, which we have developed over the years into a powerful modelling tool, which we make freely available. We have used the tools for a contains some documentation on the software along with a list of some of the student projects and publications arising from librat over the years. We are always amenable to further collaborations using librat, so drop us an email. A recent project which demonstrates an application of my 3D radiative transfer work, funded by the European Space Agency Support to Science Element, is modelling software. A nice movie (produced by Felix and the UZH group) demonstrating how the toolbox was put together is shown below. Most recently I have become interested in how we can use new, more direct EO measurements from lidar to probe canopy 3D structure and function. I have been developing new models and methods to exploit observations from spaceborne, airborne and now ground-based lidar scanning instruments to extract canopy structure and biomass. Some recent examples of ongoing work in this are are available on the Geography blog page, including This work addresses the requirement to be able to measure biomass, particularly in the tropics, more consistently, and ideally, independent of other field-based and satellite-derived measures, all of which rely on empirical (allometric) relationships between trunk diameter, height and volume (and hence biomass).

The research has been part of work contributing to provision of information on global environmental processes, particularly vegetation and the land surface more generally, that has been used nationally and internationally to inform government and agency activities. Examples of this include: development and testing of global satellite datasets such as albedo, provided by NASA and ESA and used by a wide variety of government, NGO and other users such as the Met Office and ECMWF; development of new methods for monitoring change (particularly fire impacts) and forest carbon stocks eg for NGOs, African National Parks agencies (Gabon, S. Africa). Work on albedo has featured in the IPCC AR4 (2007) and AR5 (2013). I have led various consultancy projects through UCL, working with a range of industrial partners including via collaborative PhD research funding, enabling development of new remote sensing methods and instrumentation, particularly lidar. I have sat on government panels assessing government funding in environmental science for a range of agencies including NERC, NASA, ESA, the Environmental Protection Agency of Ireland and the Australian National Research Council, among others. I have participated and/or led a number of activities to bring the work I do to the wider public, as well as trying to promote interest in science topics more generally. I have been involved in two Royal Society Summer Exhibitions, contributed material on forests, fire and carbon to the NERC representative (Prof. Shaun Quegan) presenting examples of NERC-funded environmental science to the Parliamentary Committee on Science and Technology. I have been involved in in Network for Calibration and Validation of Earth Observation Data (NERC Knowledge Transfer project) and wider international CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation activities (e.g. lead of core MODIS validation site in UK, ). I regularly give lectures to schools across a range of age groups (from 11 to 18), focusing on topics of carbon, forests and climate change. I have given live presentations to children via virtual learning environments (see A 2nd year introduction to remote sensing, covering how we acquire data, information extraction and various applications of remote sensing.

She was awarded a post-doctoral Royal Society Research Fellowship and spent a year at the Institute of Limnology, Mondsee in Austria. She returned to the Department of Geography at UCL in 1995 to take up a post as Research Fellow with the Environmental Change Research Centre (ECRC) and was promoted to Senior Research Fellow in 2001, then to Principal Research Associate in 2009, and most recently to Reader in Environmental Change since 2011. Her research interests are in aquatic ecology and palaeoecology with a focus on freshwater diatoms. Over the last twenty years she has undertaken numerous national and international research projects examining the impacts of eutrophication on standing fresh waters over a range of time scales and employing lake sediment records to assess environmental change, reference conditions and restoration targets. Since 1996, she has been involved in EU collaborative research on five large multi-partner projects (BIOMASS, EDDI, Euro-LIMPACS, WISER and REFRESH), the most recent of which is examining climate-nutrient interactions in aquatic ecosystems. She is interested in the application of science to lake management and conservation, particularly the EU Water Framework Directive. She was an invited member of the UK Lakes Task Team and UK Eutrophication Forum which advised on strategic research and development, and fed into environmental policy. Much of Helen\u2019s applied research is carried out via ENSIS Ltd, the consultancy affiliated to the ECRC, of which she was appointed Director in 2006. See Her publications include around 70 academic articles and over 80 research reports and she is a peer reviewer for numerous international scientific journals and funding bodies. She has supervised more than ten Masters and PhD students and teaches on undergraduate and masters courses including topics of lake eutrophication, palaeoecological methods, water policy, lake management and conservation. 2001- Postdoctoral Senior Research Fellow / Environmental Consultant (joint post), Environmental Change Research Centre / ENSIS Ltd, Department of Geography, University College London. 1995-2001 Postdoctoral Research Fellow / Environmental Consultant (joint post), Environmental Change Research Centre / ENSIS Ltd, Department of Geography, University College London.

These cover research topics such as nutrient reconstructions of standing waters, lake classification and monitoring, water quality and sediment assessment, lake database and risk protocol development, and restoration feasibility studies (see \u2018Impact\u2019 section for details). Helen is interested in the application of limnology and palaeolimnology to lake management and conservation, particularly the EU Water Framework Directive. The desire to contribute to the management of the aquatic environment underpins all of her research. Helen has worked closely with government and conservation agencies to define ecological and chemical reference conditions for lakes in Europe and in China. For example, she has been centrally involved in advising the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Natural England, Countryside Council for Wales (now Natural Resources Wales) and Scottish Natural Heritage on reference conditions for UK lakes including development of an ecological classification tool using diatoms (DARLEQ). This was facilitated by her invited membership of the UK Lakes Task Team (2005-2009) and provided the evidence base to inform UK Government response to the EU Water Framework Directive. She recently co-edited a special issue of Journal of Paleolimnology (vol 45, 2011) on \"Reference states and lake restoration\". Her applied diatom work has helped to inform restoration strategies of >50 lakes suffering from nutrient enrichment. She was an invited guest on BBC Radio 4s Material World programme in Sept 2005 to speak about diatoms as indicators of environmental change. She has given talks to local interest groups (e.g. Morvern Historical Society) and regularly presents her research outputs at meetings attended by a range of stakeholders (e.g. Llangorse Lake and Llyn Tegid symposia and the Loweswater Care Project). She is a member of the Environment Agency (EA) expert panel on diatom quality assurance and hosts regular training workshops for EA staff.

At the heart of my research has been a concern with the importance of materials and technologies in political and economic life. My book, (2001) focused on the vital role of technical devices in the constitution and politics of a transnational political space: the European Union. My recent book, (2013), interrogates the way in which the production of information about materials enables the activity of materials to be managed and monitored, while also generating the conditions within which controversies can proliferate over the quality and sources of the information produced. I have an on-going interest in the importance and political significance of those natural sciences, including construction engineering, chemistry, and the geo- and environmental sciences, which are less concerned with the derivation of general physical principles than with the problem of how to analyse and govern the unruly or lively behaviour of materials in the field. In earlier work I interrogated the political importance of research on, for example, air quality (1998), steel (2002), pipeline coating materials (2010), and landslides (2013). In an ethnographic study of a pharmaceutical laboratory, I highlighted the complex impact of computer chemistry on the conduct of pharmaceutical research and examined the invention of what I have termed \u2018informed materials\u2019 (2005). I am currently interested in the transformation of the geo and environmental sciences, and supervising a DPhil research project on \u2018Space and Practice in the Geosciences\u2019 (Rachel Tily). A second concern focuses on the concept and politics of energy. In part, my interest in energy draws on my recent work on the oil industry ( ). But it also emerges from my long-standing interest in materiality. Recently I have been writing on the manner in which energy has been theorised in human geography, developing from Isabelle Stengers\u2019 analysis of cosmopolitics. I am also currently interested in the politics of the idea of the Anthropocene and, more broadly, the geopolitics of the carbon economy. I supervise two doctoral students working on energy-related topics: the politics of hydraulic fracturing (Irem Kok) and the history of the idea of energy efficiency and \u2018the rebound effect\u2019 (Thomas Turnbull). Two former students have recently been awarded doctorates for theses on oil shale futures (K\u00e4rg Kama, Geographers have long been concerned with the question of how to understand the relations between the physical and the political. I have been particularly interested in the role of technologies and materials in the transformation of political and economic spaces (\u2018technological zones\u2019) and the invention of what I have termed \u2018informed materials\u2019. At the same time, I have sought to develop an account of the relation between government, politics and the political in a way that addresses the critical importance of materials in political life (2002). This has led to the development of the idea of the \u2018political situation\u2019, central to my book My approach to the relation between materiality and politics has involved a series of engagements with the work of social theorists and philosophers including Michel Foucault, Bruno Latour, Michel Callon, Gabriel Tarde, AN Whitehead and Isabelle Stengers. This has led to the publication of a number of edited collections including (2007). Much of this work has been in collaboration with others, including Thomas Osborne, Nikolas Rose, Don Slater, Mariam Fraser, Celia Lury, Nigel Thrift, Michael Halewood and Andy Goffey. Working together with a team of anthropologists including Georgina Born, Marilyn Strathern and Gisa Weszkalnys, I carried out an ESRC funded study of interdisciplinarity (2006-8). This study involved fieldwork on a range of \u2018interdisciplines\u2019 including environmental research, \u2018art-science\u2019, and ethnographic research in the IT industry. This has led to a broader analysis of diverse \u2018logics\u2019 and \u2018modes\u2019 of interdisciplinary research that cut across the boundaries of the social and natural sciences (2008). This project has resulted in the publication of a collection of essays, (Barry and Born, ), that further develops our analysis of interdisciplinary, and includes chapters by leading scholars in Science and Technology Studies, Anthropology and Social Theory. More recently, drawing on my own teaching in the history and philosophy of geography, I have sought to broaden the scope of the geographical canon and engage with the question of the relation between geographical research and other ecologies of practice. I have contributed to wider debates about science and technology policy over a long period. As a graduate student, I was a research assistant to Dr Jeremy Bray MP, opposition spokesperson on science and technology policy, and also worked at the office of Science and Technology Options Assessment at the European Parliament.

The availability of such new methods of synthesis has increased not only the range of structures which can be assembled but also the ease and economy of synthesis. During the past 30 years of his research, Professor Hisashi Yamamoto has had a tremendous impact on the field of organic chemistry through his reports of dramatic new advances in organic synthesis. Yamamoto's publications are numerous (over 450), and almost every one of them has provided an innovative new development or idea. Applications of this original and versatile chemistry have allowed him and other scientists to realize truly efficient syntheses of organic molecules of both theoretical and practical importance. Hisashi Yamamoto has uncovered novel aspects of Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts in selective organic synthesis. During his career he has discovered a wide variety of powerful new synthetic reactions, reagents, and catalysts based on acid catalysis chemistry. Through his dedicated efforts, Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid are now recognized as major tools in the synthesis of both simple and complex organic molecules. Among Yamamoto's many superb contributions the following are especially worthy of mention. His research in the area of organoaluminum chemistry has had a great impact on synthetic organic chemistry. The strong Lewis acidity of organoaluminum compounds appears to account for their strong tendency to form a stable 1:1 complex. Thus, the coordination of molecules invariably causes a change of reactivity, and the coordinated group may be activated or deactivated depending upon the type of reaction. Furthermore, with coordination of organic molecules an auxiliary bond can become coupled to the reagent and promote the desired reaction. In short, the reagents make a combined Lewis acid - Lewis base attack on a substrate with less activation energy, a field opened by Yamamoto's early and highly original studies. His aluminum amide reagents for epoxide rearrangement, biogenetic-type terpene synthesis, and the Beckmann rearrangement-alkylation reaction sequence are notable examples. He was intrigued by the chemistry of the carbonyl compound-Lewis acid complex and introduced the unusually bulky organoaluminum reagents, methylaluminum bis(2,6-di- -butyl-4-methylphenoxide) (MAD) and aluminum tris(2,6-diphenylphenoxide) (ATPH). These reagents were successfully utilized for the selective alkylation of cyclic ketones and aldehydes to generate equatorial alcohol and an anti-Cram type product, respectively, for trans- and cis-selective Claisen rearrangement, for regioselective Diels-Alder reaction, and for epoxide-aldehyde rearrangement. The ATPH - aromatic carbonyl complex reacts with nucleophiles selectively at the After these pioneering researches in Lewis acid chemistry, Yamamoto has become aware of the vast importance of chiral Lewis acids in modern asymmetric synthesis. In 1985, he first introduced binaphthol as a key ligand for chiral Lewis acid catalysts. This work was the forerunner of a vast quantity of present-day research on the binaththol based chiral Lewis acid catalyst. Based on his knowledge of organoaluminum chemistry, he designed a new and powerful organoaluminum catalyst for asymmetric hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. It was his Br\u00f8nsted acid-Lewis acid combined system, however, which gave him a unique opportunity for the most efficient asymmetric Lewis acid catalyst for Diels-Alder reaction. A similar concept was employed for his catalytic asymmetric protonation under acidic conditions, which now creates a long sought proton induced asymmetric polyene cyclization. His discovery of tartaric acid based catalyst (CAB catalyst) and amino acid based catalyst led to the first enantioselective Diels-Alder reaction of a broad range of dienes and dienophiles. The same catalyst was shown to be the first highly efficient catalyst for asymmetric aldol and ene type reactions. The reaction is simple, exceedingly stereoselective, and environmentally friendly. Direct condensation of carboxylic acids by alcohols or amines is the most important transformation of organic synthesis. Yamamoto found Lewis acid catalyst could play an important role for such esterification and amidation processes. For example, his new hafnium catalyzed esterification and boron catalyzed amidation are now becoming increasingly important to the chemical industry. More recently, he has developed new asymmetric oxidation processes based on an acid catalysis concept. His nitroso chemistry offers an entirely new access to selective organic synthesis and provides catalytic enantioselective reaction to introduce oxygen and/or nitrogen into the molecule. His pyridine based nitroso- and azo-hetero-Diels-Alder provides powerful tool for asymmetric synthesis. He also recently reported asymmetric epoxidation of homoallylic alcohols based on new vanadium catalyst, one of the most difficult asymmetric oxidations to date. After moving to Chicago, he proposed the use of 8-hydroxyquinole based chiral Lewis acid catalysis. The catalyst is designed as a rigid metal complex of -configuation. The reagent turned out to be a brand-new \"privileged ligand\" for asymmetric synthesis. Catalytic asymmetric pinacol coupling, NH reaction, Mukaiyama-Michael addition, and Pudovik reactions are now able to proceed with complete enantioselectivities. 2 cross coupling with carbonyl and allylic electrophiles. Allylic organobarium reagent, so-called \"Yamamoto's reagent\", reacts with a variety of electrophiles selectively at less substituted termini with complete stereospecificity, resolving a long-standing problem in terpene synthesis. Each of the new methodologies developed by Yamamoto has been characterized by careful design of reagent/catalyst which provides a highly practical solution to a tough synthetic problem.

First, the nuclei of C, N, O, and other heavy atoms, which make chemistry so rich, are produced in the cores of stars, the only place with sufficiently high temperature and density for nuclear fusion. The production of elements, their relative abundances, and their transport in galaxies are the results of the evolution of stars and explained by nuclear astrophysics.

The work involves the following areas: Single crystals of the reaction-center protein from Blastochloris viridis were analyzed by monochromatic and Laue diffraction, in the dark and 3 ms after illuminating the crystal with a pulsed laser. Refinement shows that ubiquinone binds only in the \"proximal\" Q Upon chemical oxidation, light harvesting complex 1 (LH1) of photosynthetic bacteria behave like molecular wires. Experimentally, charge migration within an oxidized LH1 array is monitored by following the temperature dependent changes of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line shape of oxidized bacteriochlorophyll free radicals contained in the LH1 complex. At temperatures below 10 K charge transport is very slow while at higher temperatures, rapid charge migration occurs, resulting in large changes in the EPR line shape. The temperature dependence of the EPR spectra could be described only by taking into account the glass like behavior of the protein medium, consistent with the view that the protein behaves as a frozen glass \"solvent\" for charge migration, even at room temperature.

A supersonic expansion cools the vibrations and rotations of a molecule without condensing the molecule out of the gas phase. This greatly simplifies the spectrum of the molecule and allows us to probe the structure and dynamics of large molecules whose spectra would be hopelessly complicated in a normal environment. One class of problems in which I am interested is the spectroscopy of weakly bound complexes. High resolution electronic spectroscopy is used to determine the structure of these complexes, and this, in turn, provides information about the weak intermolecular forces that hold the complexes together. These complexes also provide the opportunity to do state-to-state photochemistry in a well controlled environment. Using tunable lasers, energy can be injected into a particular vibrational mode, and the migration of this energy from the initially excited mode can be followed. A second class of problems involves the gas phase spectroscopy of large molecules such as amino acids and peptides that are not ordinarily observed in the gas phase. Such molecules have negligible vapor pressure at room temperature and, if heated, decompose before they sublime. We use laser desorption to introduce them into a molecular beam, and then study their properties spectroscopically. These molecules are naturally occurring spectroscopic probes of biologically interesting systems, but it is difficult to study their intrinsic properties in solution where they naturally occur. The increased spectral resolution available in a cold molecular beam allows us to resolve spectroscopic features due to different conformers and to study the properties of individual conformers. I am also interested in studying electron transfer and energy transfer in bichromophoric organic molecules. We have measured rates for these processes down to the time resolution of our nsec. lasers, and we will extend these measurements to shorter times using fsec lasers. Bichromophoric molecules have two aromatic chromophores covalently bound to and separated by an inert spacer such as a methylene chain. By varying the spacer and the chromophores, it is possible to tune the interaction between the chromophores in a well controlled way. Finally, I am interested in studying the laser desorption process. When a solid composed of large, fragile molecules is exposed to pulsed laser radiation, it is often possible to vaporize intact molecules as large as small proteins with no damage to the molecule. This is a striking and unintuitive phenomenon, and I am interested in understanding the mechanism by which it occurs. Using a new instrument that has recently been built, we are able to measure the kinetic energy, internal state, and angular distributions of molecules that have been laser desorbed.

We also study genes encoding the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase in plants, parasites, and mammals. The cyanobacterium Anabaena grows in filaments of 100 cells or more. When starved for nitrogen, specialized cells called heterocysts differentiate from the photosynthetic vegetative cells at regular intervals along each filament. Heterocysts are anaerobic factories for nitrogen fixation; in them, the nitrogenase enzyme complex is synthesized and the components of the oxygen-evolving photosystem II are turned off. More than 1000 genes are believed to be differentially expressed during the (irreversible) development of a heterocyst from a vegetative cell. We have cloned and sequenced genes for nitrogen fixation (nif) and others encoding RuBP carboxylase, glutamine synthetase, the D1, CP-47 and water-oxidizing proteins of photosystem II, all the components of phycobilisome rods, and the sigma and core sub-units of RNA polymerase. Mutants unable to fix nitrogen aerobically have been isolated. Among these are some that have altered heterocyst morphology or an altered pattern. Four of these have been studied in detail, using a complementation system to isolate the wild-type gene defective in the mutants. One mutant fails to deposit the necessary glycolipid layer that forms part of the heterocyst envelope. A second mutant fails to make any heterocysts at all. A third makes them only at the ends of filaments. A fourth makes them too late and too frequently! In these cases, the sequences of the complementing genes are highly informative, corresponding to proteins that participate in environment-sensing regulatory cascades. The relationships among these regulatory proteins are being worked out by using the Green Fluorescent Protein from the jellyfish as a cell-specific reporter of gene expression and by controlling expression of the genes with a Cu++-responsive promoter. Fatty acid synthesis, in plants as well as in cyanobacteria, begins with the reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC in bacteria, including cyanobacteria, is comprised of four subunits: biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase (BC), and two subunits of carboxyltransferase. In chicken, rat, yeast and plants all of these domains reside in a single polypeptide. We have cloned and sequenced genes encoding BC and BCCP from two cyanobacteria and used this information to design probes for the cloning of ACC cDNA from wheat. We have a complete cDNA for the wheat cytoplasmic enzyme and have expressed it in yeast. It turns out that wheat chloroplasts also have an ACC and this one is the real target of the grass-specific herbicides. The chloroplast ACC has been expressed in yeast also, as a chimera with the N-terminal half coming from the cytoplasmic enzyme. This system was used to identify the amino acid residue that is responsible for sensitivity or resistance to the herbicides. Parasites such as malaria and Toxoplasma contain a primitive chloroplast called the apicoplast. We discovered that the apicoplast contains an ACC that is similar to the chloroplast enzyme of grasses and we have shown that it is the target of the same herbicides that kill grasses. One of our herbicides inhibits the growth of Toxoplasma in human cells in culture and also inhibits the multiplication of Plasmodium yoelli in the mouse. We intend to use the yeast gene-replacement system to screen for new inhibitors of these parasites. Humans also have two forms of ACC. One, expressed in the cytoplasm of liver and fat cells, is essential for fatty acid synthesis. The other form is expressed in muscle cells and is transported into mitochondria, where it plays a role in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Mice without this second form eat a lot and do not gain weight. We are cloning and expressing the human ACCs in yeast and using those yeast strains to screen for inhibitors of ACC2 that do not affect ACC1. These inhibitors will be good candidates for drugs to treat obesity. ACC also provides an entry into cancer research. The human protein BRCA1 is involved in breast cancer. Recently it has been shown by others to form tight complexes with ACC. Since we are already cloning the human ACC gene, we can look at the ACC domains involved in that interaction and determine which ACC activities are present in the complex.

Our focus in these areas is on developing analytically tractable model that are useful in predicting new behavior, explaining perplexing data, and in guiding future experiments and the design of novel materials. We also pursue some simulations as necessary to test our theories and/or to guide the formulation of suitable approximations. Many proteins in solution fold into beautiful structures that are intimately related to their function, while other proteins remain unfolded, presumably to enabling their functioning. We have developed a coarse-grained self-consistent model for predicting the folded structure and the mechanism of folding of small globular proteins without recourse, as is generally used in the field, to machine learning methods which are useful but which obscure the underlying physics. Our methods have been tested against the recent all-atom molecular dynamics simulation by D. E. Shaw and company for the dynamics of folding of twelve small, fast folding proteins using a supercomputer designed for MD simulations and built by Shaw, a hedge fund billionaire! Our simulations yield comparable results to Shaw (he gets better structures for six structures, while we beat him for the other six structures) but require on the order of 104 to 105 times less computer time (assuming that the MD simulations are performed on the same computer cluster as our coarse-grained simulations). Our current interests include protein folding in membranes, protein recognition, folding in larger proteins, and the nature of the poorly understood \u201cstructure\u201d and behavior of intrinsically unfolded proteins. The Nobel laureate P. W. Anderson stated in 1995 that the \u201cdeepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and the glass transition.\u201d We have developed a theory for the influence of monomer molecular structure and interactions on the nature of glass-formation in glass forming systems, with particular emphasis on the glass transition T (a measure of temperature sensibility), the two material properties that are most important in dictating the method in which a material may be processed. Our predictions of the influence of the relative flexibilities of the backbone and side groups on the fragility of polymers with the structures of poly(n-\u03b1-olefins) have been verified by experiments as have been our predictions of the factors promoting anti-plasticization of glass forming polymers by the addition of small molecule diluents. Our current interests include devising methods for determine the parameters of our theory from experimental data, studying glass-formation in systems with strong, specific, self-assembling interactions, and more. The development of a statistical mechanical theory for the thermodynamic properties of thin, dense polymers had remained an important unsolved problem in polymer physics, but we have recently devised a zeroth order lattice model theory of thin polymer films that is expected to be qualitatively correct but quantitatively crude. Our first goal is to devise methods for evaluating the higher order contributions in a systematic expansion for the properties of thin polymer systems. Subsequent work will study the influence of monomer molecular structure and interactions on the properties of polymer films. The use of mixed solvents figures predominantly in methods for synthesizing and/or separate the components of a solution. Our interests focus on predicting the complex phase behavior that may emerge from the solvation of polymers in solutions of mixed self-assembling solvents. The possibilities are huge, and the resultant patterns can be highly non-intuitive, such as in the phenomena of cosolvency (cononsolvency), where a solute becomes solubility (insoluble) in a mixed solvent for which the solute is poorly (well) miscible in the individual pure solvents. Recently, we have begun research on the influence of polarization in systems with charged, highly polarizing particles. Our theory provides insight into experiments displaying the aggregation dynamics of small micro-particles. Fig. 1.

I have had the pleasure of working with many PhDs, postdocs, and exceptional undergraduates at the University of Chicago. We focused on the synthesis and examination of new ring systems specifically designed as probes into the effects of molecular geometry on bonding, reactivity, strain, etc. In the course of our work we were the first to synthesize cubane, pentaprismane, [2.2.2]propellane, the [n.2.2.2]paddlanes, and many, many other highly strained, so-called unnatural compounds ( These systems gave us special opportunities to study the behavior of exceptionally strained molecules vis-a-vis their propensity for rearrangement and reaction. Cubane is the most highly strained, kinetically stable ring system available in multi-gram quantities. We used it as the precursor of yet more highly strained compounds, including 1(9)-homocubene (the most highly twisted olefin), cubene, (the most highly pyramidalized olefin), and such intriguing species as 1,4-dehydrocubane, cubyl cation (the \"least likely\" cation), and the cubylcarbinyl radical (the fastest rearranging saturated radical). These have record properties and as such have proven to be of fundamental importance to understanding the boundaries of bonding between carbons. As the geometric requirements of such compounds are far from ordinary, tactical synthesis is an exceptional challenge. Much of our work, therefore, was on the development and application of new synthesis methods and techniques. A few examples: Cubanes and other unnatural products offer many and diverse applications. Octanitrocubane,\u00ad first prepared in my labs by an extraordinary combinations of techniques, is remarkably stable. But it is also probably the most powerful known nonnuclear explosive. I am comfortably sure it will never be used \u2013 it is far too expensive to make. I can note happily that my hypothesis of pharmaceutical utility made years ago has recently been validated: cubane has been shown to be a suitable bioisostere to replace the benzene part of widely different agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

These are represented primarily by components found in meteorites. Some nuclides provide information on time-scales, such as Cr from supernova events. Oxygen isotopes play a unique role in serving as a chemical tracer for solar nebular processes, and exhibit characteristic \"isotopic anomalies\" representing isolation of various chemical reservoirs on scales with dimensions ranging from micrometers (individual crystals) to thousands of kilometers (planets). The cosmochemical issues addressed by meteorite studies bear directly on the origin of the planets and the initial conditions of formation of the Earth, particularly including its initial thermal state and the abundance and distribution of its internal energy sources. Isotopic studies of terrestrial materials are widely used to study the evolution of the Earth's major chemical systems: core, mantle, crust, ocean, atmosphere up to the present time. Studies of sulfur isotopes in photochemical reactions may bear on the early evolution of our oxygen-rich atmosphere. Major advances in isotopic cosmochemistry and geochemistry depend on the development of ever better techniques for precise isotopic analysis of very small samples. We pioneered in the use of the ion microprobe, a device based on \"secondary-ion mass spectrometry,\" for determination of elemental and isotopic abundances of elements at low concentrations in microscopic samples.

Its major topics include a) the phases and phase changes of small systems, b) the topographies of multidimensional potential surfaces and the dynamics these imply, and c) dynamics of proteins and their interactions. The first revealed how first-order phase transitions emerge, in the large-system limit, from the dynamic equilibria of phase-like forms of clusters. The phase behavior of small systems is very different from that of bulk phases. The \"phases\" of clusters are as much like components as they are phases. Hence they are not restricted to sharp coexistence curves, and the Gibbs Phase Rule is not applicable to them. Studying the small-system analogues of second-order phase transitions revealed two kinds of second-order transitions. The studies of topographies and dynamics have addressed questions such as, \"What characteristics of multidimensional potential surfaces will reveal whether a substance is a glass-former or a structure-seeker?\" We learn that substances whose potential surface topographies are sawtooth-like are good glass-formers, and substances whose potential surfaces are staircase-like are good structure-seekers. The structure-seekers include materials that crystallize readily, such as alkali halides, and proteins that fold readily into specific kinds of structures. From a knowledge of interlinked sequences of minima and saddles, one can construct kinetic rate coefficients, and from these, a full master equation for any temperature. The master equations can then be used to generate an optimal control procedure to bring an ensemble of clusters or nanoparticles toward a target morphology. The studies of proteins, in collaboration with colleagues in Chemistry and in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, have led to new understanding of how the folding process occurs, and how proteins interact and attach to other molecules. One recent finding is how proteins with hydrogen bonds exposed on their surfaces attach to hydrophobic substances, such as lipids. This work is now developing an integrated, multiscale method to model the evolution of protein dynamics from picoseconds to seconds. Involving both theory and experiment, this research deals with electron correlation in the valence shells of atoms and with simple ionization and collision processes. A fundamental theoretical question here is, \"What are the best approximate constants of motion and corresponding quantum numbers for electrons in a many-electron system, independent-particle, as in the Hartree-Fock picture, or collective, and, if collective, of what sort?\" In the two-valence-electron atoms, the electrons behave collectively, like very anharmonic rotor-vibrators around their atomic cores. Recent studies have been directed toward predicting and interpreting experiments to reveal the nature and degree of correlation of such electrons. Related experiments and theory involve photoionization and collisions: resonant multiphoton ionization, collisions of monoenergetic, low-energy electrons with excited atoms leaving the electrons accelerated and the atoms de-excited (superelastic collisions), and collisions of excited energy-donor atoms with negative ions, in which the excitation energy of the donors releases the \"extra\" electron of the negative ion, a process called \"Penning detachment.\" Thermodynamics provides limits on the performance of systems that produce or consume work. The limits of classical thermodynamics are based on reversible -- and therefore infinitely slow -- models. It is possible to develop more realistic limits by incorporating finite-time or nonzero-rate constraints into the definition of a thermodynamic system. Such analyses provoke several questions. First, under what conditions it is possible to define generalizations of thermodynamic potentials whose changes give the optimum performance of a finite-time process? Second, what are such functions are and how can we evaluate them? Third, how can we find the paths that yield those optimal performances? Systems studied this way include automobile engines and separation processes such as distillation. There are also more abstract questions: what constitutes the best, minimal set of variables to describe a system well out of equilibrium, for which normal thermodynamic variables are not sufficient? How can one describe the simultaneous, coupled flows of mass, heat, and entropy in a nonuniform fluid? A problem still more general is the quest for a paradigmatic classification of dissipative systems. C. Wang, R. S. Berry and J.

Our overarching philosophy is the exploration of the relationships between chemical structure and resulting properties so as to facilitate discovery of new materials for organic solar cells, organic electronics, water splitting, and other practical applications. Our group is engaged in developing low bandgap materials that can efficiently harvest and convert solar energy into electricity. Two types of molecules are being designed and synthesized. a) p-Type low bandgap semiconducting polymers both linear and two-dimensional. b) n-Type semiconductors as electron-acceptors. We are developing state of art materials for both fundamental studies and device optimization. Extensive effort is devoted to the characterization of these new materials with regard to their structural and photophysical properties. In addition to designing functional materials, approaches to optimizing light conversion are pursued through device engineering and the optimization of processing conditions, including plasmonic enhancement of light absorption, nanotubes for increased charge transport, and ternary blend solar cells. In addition to photovoltaics, one approach to convert sunlight into usable forms of energy, is to utilize solar energy to photo-catalytically convert inert chemicals, such as water and carbon dioxide, into energy-rich, storable chemical fuels. Light-induced splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen is the most attractive approach not only because it can provide one potential solution to the world\u2019s ever-increasing energy demands, but also because the resulting fuel is environmentally benign. Our method toward this goal is the development of photocatalysts based on semiconducting polymers chelated with transition metals. In addition to their photocatalytic effect, we also study other physical properties of polymer metal complexes, such as photorefractive effects, photoconductivity, light emission and novel redox properties. These materials exhibit promising potential for applications in solar energy conversion as photocatalysts for water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, sensors, polymer-supported electrodes, nonlinear optics, and electroluminescence. This project explores the power of organic chemistry in designing and synthesizing molecular electronic components, such as molecular diodes, molecular switches, and information storage material. A typical example is the demonstration of edge-on chemical gating effect in molecular wires utilizing the pyridinoparacyclophane moiety as the gate. The results show behavior similar to field-effect transistors. At the same time, protonation/deprotonation of the pyridine ring triggers a reversible alteration of the electrical properties of the molecular wire, leading to a binary on/off switch system. Another example is the synthesis of molecular diodes consisting of conjugated diblock and demonstration of their rectification effect.

These multiscale methods include systematic coarse-graining approaches, mesoscopic modeling, and multiscale bridging between all of the relevant scales. Our multiscale methods are being applied to actin filaments, microtubules, biological membranes and membrane proteins, nucleic acids, peptide aggregation and self-assembly, viral capsids, liquids, and polymers. Charge Transport: The transport of charge (protons and electrons) in aqueous and biomolecular systems is another important multiscale phenomenon. Here, the smallest scale is at the scale of the electrons because such processes involve either the electrons directly or indirectly, often in the form of proton transport (via, for example, the Grotthuss hopping mechanism in which chemical bonds and hydrogen bonds along the water chain are rearranged to translocate the excess protonic charge). Proton transport is also dependent on the conformation, dynamics, and assembly of the medium in which it occurs. Our group has worked for more than twenty years to develop a multiscale theoretical and computational methodology to describe proton transport phenomena in biology and in a host of other systems, at large times and length scales. Schematically depicted in the figure below is the range of the systems we have studied. Our group also carries out theoretical and computational studies of charge solvation phenomena and dynamics in materials such as proton and hydroxide exchange membranes (e.g., for fuel cell applications), as well as in complex liquids such as electrolytes and room temperature ionic liquids. Fundamental Quantum Theory: The Voth group has a long-standing interest in the development of new quantum mechanical perspectives and methods for quantum dynamics, kinetics, and statistical mechanics. Most recently, we have begun to explore the meaning(s) of coarse-graining in quantum mechanics, first for quantum statistical mechanics (see figure below) and in the future for condensed phase quantum dynamics.

We focus on three primary goals: First, we are interested in imitating cellular behavior using semiconductor nanomaterials and augmenting existing biological systems with semiconductor components. We hope to stably incorporate inorganic materials into preexisting cellular frameworks, examining both how single cells interact with these new artificial components and what uniquely inorganic properties (e.g., electrical and optoelectronic responses, bioorthogonality) we can exploit to derive a more nuanced control over these cellular systems. Second, we are developing new biophysical tools to understand subcellular dynamics. In particular, the ability to control the electrophysiology of living cells in real time with good spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for advancing our knowledge of cellular signaling pathways. However, minimally invasive intracellular or intercellular recording and modulation have been difficult to obtain as traditional techniques use probes that are too large to leave the cell membrane intact or to allow for satisfactory spatiotemporal resolution. Similarly, the rigidity of many of these devices prevents them from easily interfacing with soft biological systems. Our group is interested in developing original solutions to overcome these obstacles, allowing for improved intracellular or intercellular biointerfaces. Finally, we are seeking designs and solutions for semiconductor-based active matter. Biological systems are capable of a large degree of morphological and synthetic control, achieving various transformations under relatively benign conditions. Additionally, biological systems exhibit many unique properties not commonly observed in inorganic world such as homeostatic regulation and environmental adaptability. We are interested in exploring analogs to these types of behaviors in semiconductor systems, and examining how these insights can be applied towards new material and device designs for applications in regenerative medicine.

By combining expertise in colloidal synthesis, self-assembly, and characterization of nanomaterial properties, our group creates novel materials for electronic, photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and catalytic applications. Colloidal synthesis of functional inorganic nanostructures has developed into a new branch of synthetic chemistry. Starting with preparations of simple objects like spherical nanoparticles, the field is now moving toward more and more sophisticated structures where composition, size, shape, and connectivity of multiple parts of a multicomponent structure can be tailored in an independent and predictable manner. Inspired by the way most solids form in nature, with individual atoms or molecules assembling themselves into rigid, highly uniform arrays, we study assembly of monodisperse nanocrystals into ordered superstructures. Assembling nanoscale functional building blocks provides a powerful modular approach to the design of novel materials and \u2018metamaterials\u2019 with programmable physical and chemical properties. Bringing together compounds of intrinsically different functionality constitutes a particularly powerful route to creating novel functional materials with synergetic properties found in neither of the constituents. Binary nanoparticle superlattices (BNSL) self-assembled from different combinations of semiconductor, magnetic, metallic and dielectric nanocrystals show amazing structural diversity. The range of materials which can be used as building blocks in BNSL structures seems to be limited only by our ability to make a particular material in form of monodisperse nanoparticles. Self-assembly of functional nanoparticles into single- and multicomponent superlattices offers nearly endless possibilities for creating novel materials for a range of applications from photovoltaic and thermoelectric devices to non-linear optics, multiferroics, and multicomponent catalysts. However, we have very limited understanding of the processes which govern BNSL formation and determine stability of different structures. We investigate the fundamental aspects of self-assembly in the nano world. Nanocrystal superlattices constitute a novel type of condensed matter whose properties originate both from the properties of individual nanocrystals and the collective phenomena caused by the crosstalk of the superlattice building blocks. We study electronic properties (carrier mobility, doping, charge transport mechanism, photoconductivity, thermopower) and heat transport in single- and multicomponent nanocrystal solids. The knowledge obtained from fundamental studies of nanocrystal assemblies will be used for development of practical solution-processed devices utilizing nanocrystals and nanocrystal assemblies. The performance of solution-processed nanocrystal transistors and solar cells compares favorably with competing technologies. The nanocrystal field effect transistors allow reversible switching between n- and p-transport, providing options for printable complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and p-n junctions.

Meeting this lofty objective requires complete command over chemoselectivity: the ability to differentiate and controllably functionalize any site within a given molecule. The Snyder research group uses the inspiration of Nature\u2019s chemoselective syntheses of tens of thousands of natural products through highly controlled cyclization and functionalization chemistries both to provide a sense of our ultimate goal and to identify critical challenges worthy of laboratory execution. Efforts to date have focused on oligomeric polyphenols, halogenated natural products, stereochemically-dense terpenes, and polycyclic alkaloids, resulting in several new reagents, strategies, and tactics of broad applicability. Br (BDSB) is the flagship member and is commercially available from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. These reagents are the first that can achieve halonium-induced polyene cyclizations for stereochemically diverse terpenes. They have also allowed the rapid synthesis of 8- and 9-membered bromoethers of the class via a unique biogenetic hypothesis as well as accomplished a positionally selective electrophilic aromatic substitution that other halogen sources could not achieve. We have also developed a number of strategies and methods for rapid polycycle construction, evidenced by a recent total synthesis of the stereochemically rich, but largely non-functionalized terpene known as rippertenol. In work towards compact alkaloids such as scholarisine A, members of the norsecurinines, and gracilamine, we have developed unique C\u2013H functionalization chemistries, -heterocyclic carbene-induced cascade bond constructions, and pyrone Diels\u2013Alder chemistries which can rapidly form multiple ring systems at once where previous efforts required many steps. We have also pioneered the first strategy, predicated on the identification of non-obvious starting materials and a number of chemoselective transformations and reaction cascades, for the controlled (and sometimes gram-scale) synthesis of diverse oligomeric natural product families, unlocking their members for further biological exploration through collaborative study.

The unifying theme in the Sibener Group is to expand understanding of interfacial phenomena at the molecular level that spans fundamental knowledge discovery to applications such as energy systems. Specific areas of interest include: Surface reaction dynamics; gas-surface interaction potentials; phonon structure of surfaces and thin films; gas-surface collisional energy transfer; surface metallurgy and metallic oxidation; self-organization of molecular and polymer thin films including chiral systems; surface dynamics of polymers; superconducting radio frequency (SRF) materials for advanced accelerators; national security with focus on trace gas detection and chemical defense; water purification; ice chemistry in terrestrial and astrophysical environments; hierarchical assembly of functional nanomaterials for energy applications; and electronic and vibronic structure of nanoscale electronic interfaces. Examination of collective behavior in nanoparticle assembled materials studied at the single nanoparticle limit at cryogenic temperatures with scanning tunneling and conductive AFM spectroscopy is a recent addition to the program. Increasingly, studies in the group combine expertise in molecular beam scattering with scanning tunneling/atomic force microscopy visualization of dynamically evolving interfaces. Multiply-modulated molecular beam scattering techniques are used for the elucidation of heterogeneous reaction mechanisms and dynamics These experiments examine the potential energy surfaces that govern the dynamics of volatile reaction products as a function of adsorbate density, including how interadsorbate effects influence potential energy surfaces. Kinetically-activated reagents are employed to enhance the reaction rate and selectivity of heterogeneous reactions, such as for the Synthesis Gas reaction on rhodium. Another example is how synergistic effects involving UV light and atomic oxygen influence the reactivity of photoactive polymer surfaces, important for delineating how materials react in low-Earth-orbit environments. The group\u2019s newest efforts focus on geometry- and stereo-selected reaction dynamics. Single phonon inelastic He scattering is a surface sensitive method that can be used to map out the full surface phonon structure of clean or molecule-covered interfaces. Recent work has focused on new electronic interfaces, developed at Caltech, that have improved redox properties for electronic and electrochemical applications. Combined experiments and quantum dynamics calculations have shown how molecular vibrations can hybridize with and modify the phonon band structure of methyl-Si(111) interfaces. Studies of gas-surface collisional energy exchange have helped define understanding of the hierarchy of interfacial energy-exchange processes responsible for energy accommodation, sticking, and gaseous condensation. This work is quantitatively addressing how single, few, and multiphonon events contribute to energy exchange under an extraordinarily broad range of dynamical conditions. Quantitative comparisons and beautiful agreement with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations have led to improved understanding of energy and momentum exchange at complex molecular interfaces that are of importance not only for fundamental understanding, but for the refinement of advanced aircraft and spacecraft flight surfaces. Another ongoing effort is in the area of surface metallurgy and metallic oxidation, where molecular beam and time-lapse STM studies have elucidated definitive oxidation mechanisms for atomic, energetic, and electron-assisted processes. The group is currently examining the oxidation and nitridation of Nb to improve understanding of how surface-to-bulk oxygen and nitrogen transport occurs, and how it can influence the performance of superconducting RF cavities used in particle accelerators. The dynamical properties and organization of molecular and polymeric thin films is another current focus of the group. Atomic force microscopy is being used to examine the pathways by which defects evolve and annihilate during the annealing of polymers. Recent work has led to the development of new methods, now widely adopted, for guiding the spatial organization of diblock copolymers in nano-confinement while achieving near structural perfection. Experiments being done at elevated temperatures above the glass transition where real-time/real-space dynamics for domain organization, grain boundary mobility, and defect elimination can be followed, revealing precise details of the mechanism and kinetics for polymer organization in thin films. In separate work on molecular systems, our current focus is on understanding and controlling the chirality of adsorbed films. The Sibener Group has pioneered the use of low energy, nondestructive neutral atom inelastic scattering to probe the surface vibrational characteristics of polymer surfaces. This has proven to be a most incisive approach, revealing how polymer dynamics change due to nano-confinement as film thickness approaches the radii of gyration of the polymer chains. Helium scattering has also been used to assess how surface vibrational dynamics change when going from the amorphous to the complex crystalline phase of PET. The group has several ongoing projects that focus on the chemistry of ice, especially the trapping and release of adsorbed and embedded trace gases for purposes of environmental, astrophysical, and national defense science. Recently, work in this area has demonstrated that high-energy gas-surface collisions can embed species into ice once energetic barriers have been exceeded. These latter experiments are significant for many fields, including trace gas collection and detection, climate change, and astrophysical chemistry involving planetary systems, interstellar dust, and comets. We are one of the lead groups at UChicago that is participating in the Institute for Molecular Engineering\u2019s new Water Research Initiative. This new effort has components that are associated with the catalytic destruction and filtering of contaminants. A powerful route for the creation of functional nanomaterials is hierarchical self-assembly. Here one can use top-down/bottom-up methods to organize complex structures that would be prohibitively time consuming to fabricate using traditional lithography-only paradigms. The group has been using such methods for the synthesis of functional photovoltaic thin film devices, ultra-high density magnetic systems involving magnetic nanoparticles, and highly efficacious surface enhanced Raman (SERS) substrates.

Most of our work on ion channels is computational, though we have recently started to add an experimental component to our research with electrophysiological measurements and protein crystallography. The computational approach, called \"molecular dynamics\" (MD), is central to our work. It consists of constructing detailed atomic models of the macromolecular system and, having described the microscopic forces with a potential function, using Newton's classical equation, F=MA, to simulate the dynamical motions of all the atoms as a function of time. The calculated trajectory, though an approximation to the real world, provides detailed information about the time course of the atomic motions, which is nearly impossible to access experimentally. We use such all-atom MD simulations to rigorously compute conformational free energies, and binding free energies. In addition, other computational approaches, at differing levels of complexity and sophistication, can be very useful. In particular, Poisson Boltzmann (PB) continuum electrostatic models, in which the influence of the solvent is incorporated implicitly, plays an increasingly important role in estimating the solvation free energy of macromolecular assemblies. We are also developing new computational approaches (polarizable force field, solvent boundary potentials, efficient sampling methods) for studying biological macromolecular systems. Y.L. Lin, Y.

Chemistry is ultimately about chemical reactions\u2014developing them, understanding them, and using them to make interesting, useful molecules. Much of the activity in my research group is aimed at discovering new ways to make complex molecules, including designing unique strategies to certain families of natural products and developing broadly effective methods for chemical synthesis. The targets for our synthesis studies are selected for their intricate structures as well as their potent biological activities. We strive to devise concise, stereocontrolled, and high yielding routes using strategies that examine interesting aspects of structure and reactivity. Among the targets that we have successfully synthesized are elisapterosin B, pederin, the welwitindolinones, and strychnine. In recent years, a significant part of my group has focused on the development of effective catalysts for enantioselective reactions. The biologically important family of alkaloids provided the initial motivation for much of this work. We found that salen-based chiral complexes catalyze the Diels-Alder reactions of amino-substituted dienes and a broad range of dienophiles to produce the cycloadducts in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Significantly, we discovered that TADDOL, a simple, commercially available chiral alcohol, functions as a catalyst for highly enantioselective cycloadditions. Reminiscent of enzymes and antibodies, hydrogen bonding to TADDOL provides both tremendous rate acceleration and exquisite selection for the formation of one enantiomer of the product. Considerable effort in the group is directed at the design and development of novel classes of hydrogen bonding catalysts, such as squaramides, for asymmetric synthesis. 1.

Our laboratory integrates organic chemistry, physical chemistry, enzymology, and molecular biology to gain a fundamental understandingof nucleic acid structure and mechanisms of RNA catalysis. Using the principles and techniques of organic chemistry and molecular biology, we manipulate the structure of RNA molecules at precise locations in ways that are designed to elucidate questions about biological function. We aim to gain a fundamental understanding of the role divalent metal ions play in phosphoryl transfer reactions that occur during RNA splicing, a fundamental step in genetic expression. One experimental system that we are using to address these issues is the self-splicing intervening sequence RNA of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena. Shortened forms of this RNA can act as enzymes, catalyzing the sequence-specific cleavage of RNA and DNA substrates with multiple turnover. We use sulfur substitution of oxygen substituents on the phosphoryl group undergoing transfer to reveal the transition state interactions between the ribozyme and the scissile phosphate. We are also interested in the development of new methods and model systems for studying RNA molecules. For example, we recently designed a series of nucleoside analogues in which the C2\u00d5-beta hydrogen atom ofthe ribose is replaced by CH . These analogues provide a systematic way to perturb the acidity of the 2'-OH group, thereby allowing us to probe the important role of this functional group in RNA-mediated biological processes. Restrictocin is a small protein (149 amino acids) so toxic that a single molecule can kill an entire cell. This protein, from Aspergillus restrictus, is a member of a group of functionally homologous cytotoxins that includes the better-known sarcin. Its mechanism of toxicity is fascinating: a single protein can cross the cell membrane and cleave the 23\u00d028S ribosomal RNA at a single phosphodiester bond. The cleavage site resides within a region of the ribosomal RNA known as the sarcin/ricinloop (SRL), which folds into a tetraloop motif and abulged-G motif. The SRL participates in the binding of elongation factors during protein synthesis. Considering that the 28S ribosomal RNA contains thousands of phosphodiester bonds, the apparent specificity of this ribonuclease is remarkable. This single cleavage event inactivates the ribosome and consequently abolishes its ability to carry out protein synthesis, which ultimately leads to death of the cell. This scenario immediately prompts a number of questions: How does the protein cross the cell membrane? Does it really possess the attributed specificity? Is every ribosome in the cell inactivated or does a single inactivation event lead to activation of an apoptotic pathway?Additionally, the potency of this protein immediately suggests a potential clinic use as an anticancer drug. All of these are interesting questions that we hope to answer. In addition, this system has broader significance in biology as a model system to study RNA-protein interactions, which are ubiquitous and mediate numerous important events during gene expression. The crystal structures of restrictocin and the SRL RNA have been solved in isolation, and Carl Correll's lab (University of Chicago) has solved a structure of an SRL analog in complex with restrictocin. Upon complex formation the geometry of the tetraloop is dramatically rearranged by base restacking and base flipping. Remarkably, few functional studies have been reported on this protein. Our initial focus will be to determine the dynamic changes that occur in the SRL when it binds to restrictocin and to elucidate the energetic contributions that enzyme-RNA substrate contacts play in cleavage-site recognition and catalysis.

Our research is multidisciplinary; the group includes researchers with diverse backgrounds, including chemistry, physics, material science, and electrical engineering. One main research goal is to build atomically-thin integrated circuitry. In order to build atomically thin integrated circuitry, we develop advanced growth, characterization and device fabrication methods for2D layered materials, which include electrically conducting graphene, insulating hBN and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. For example, we reported the atom-resolution imaging of individual grain boundaries in graphene using transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Nature, 2011 [4]) and investigated their electrical properties (Science, 2012 [5]). We also developed a method for producing atomically thin lateral heterojuctions within individual 2D films (Nature, 2012 [6]), and reported the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of wafer-scale three-atom-thick semiconductor films with high mobility (Nature, 2015 [9]). Our results enable the fabrication of electrically isolated active and passive elements embedded in continuous, one- and few-atom-thick sheets, which could further be manipulated and stacked to form complex devices at the ultimate thickness limit. Another research goal is to explore novel electrical, optical, and optoelectronic properties of low-dimensional nanostructures, which will allow the development of advanced devices, including highly efficient solar cells, ultrasensitive infrared bolometric detectors, and novel valleytronic and spintronic devices.

By integrating chemical synthesis, cell biology and mass spectrometry platforms, our research aims to identify novel biological mechanisms underlying diseases, such as diabetes and cancer, and to subsequently develop innovative diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to impact these disorders. We are specifically interested in developing new chemical tools and technologies to study complexity and dynamics in the proteome, thus enabling targeted manipulation of protein targets and the pathways they govern. We are actively pursuing projects in the following research areas: Control of protein structure and function via reversible small molecule binding and covalent post-translational modifications are well-established and conserved biochemical regulatory mechanisms in cell biology. These events integrate diverse signaling pathways in the cell and also allow for significant expansion of the chemical and functional diversity afforded by finite genetic products (~23,000) by more than an order of magnitude (~1,000,000 unique proteins). While these mechanisms are involved in all aspects of biology, we lack a complete map of these chemical modifications, including their tissue-, cell- and temporal regulation and, importantly, their regulatory roles in normal and pathologic cell signaling. Our group has several areas of active research into the origins and roles of novel protein modification networks in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, particularly within the contexts of aging, metabolic disease and cancer. For example, we have discovered several novel protein post-translational modifications resulting from the interactions between proteins and reactive primary metabolites formed by glucose, a ubiquitous energy source in life. These non-enzymatic modifications represent a direct connection between glycolytic flux and alterations in the structure and function of key proteins, including glycolytic enzymes themselves, pointing to the existence of an ancient and likely biomedically important intrinsic feedback pathway in mammalian cells. Using a combination of cell biology, mass spectrometry and chemical probe development, we are exploring the fundamental biochemical processes that regulate the formation and removal of these modifications, their effects on target protein structure and function, and their ability to serve as a novel form of intracellular signaling, integrating glucose metabolism with other pathways in normal as well as diseased processes. Our group is developing novel chemical proteomic technology platforms with applications ranging from basic biology to drug discovery. One area of active research is the development of proteomic platforms for the discovery and mapping of protein-ligand (e.g. protein-metabolite, protein-drug, protein-protein) interaction networks in native cellular environments. Connecting ligands to their biologically relevant binding partner(s) is a major challenge in unraveling cellular signaling events as well as understanding the mechanism of action for chemical probes and even existing drugs. We are developing chemical proteomic platforms that will enable systems-level views of ligand interactions proteome-wide. Specific interest areas included: development of label-free chemical proteomic platforms; development of novel chemical probes for poorly characterized protein families; application of proteomic platforms in relevant disease models to discover new diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets in cancer. Nature employs a myriad of chemical modifications to control protein structure and function. For example, subtle chemical transformations like disulfide bridge formation and protein acetylation can have profound effects on protein structure, stability and half-life. In addition to our exploration of natural protein modification networks in cellular biochemistry and physiology, our group is interested in drawing upon these strategies to develop synthetically-modified protein- and peptide-based chemical probes. These efforts compliment our interests in disease associated biological pathways by enabling chemical probe development for classes of biomolecules that have proven difficult to target with conventional small molecules. Protein-based drugs have become a major area of drug discovery in the past few decades, mainly owing to their ability to bind protein targets with exceptional potency and specificity relative to traditional small molecule drugs. These desirable properties, however, are often accompanied by limitations in target space, route of administration and stability. Our group is developing novel approaches to synthetically modify or mimic proteins and peptides to improve their drug-like properties, which include protease-resistance, in vivo half-life, and the ability to access intracellular targets. Through total- and semi-synthesis, we are employing these strategies to develop novel classes of peptide and protein mimetics to address difficult biological targets in human diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

The immediate impact of my research has been the development of new electronic structure methods with improved accuracy and efficiency for small-to-medium-sized atoms and molecules - both ground and excited-state properties. These methods will assist chemists in investigating experimental properties such as molecular geometries, bond stretching, bond polarity, electron density, dissociation, and excitation energies with accuracy. The new methodology is not limited to electronic structure but is also appropriate for other aspects of chemistry including the prediction of vibrational and rotational molecular properties.

In my research the electron pair is elevated to a more prominent role in electronic structure. The dream of has existed for many years. It was initially inspired by the observation that because electrons interact only two-at-a-time, the electronic energy may be expressed exactly as a simple, functional of the coordinates of two electrons. The distribution of the two electrons, however, may not properly represent a realistic, many-electron system. The development of systematic rules for constraining two electrons to represent a collection of more-than-two electrons is called the In 1994 Professor Carmela Valdemoro achieved an approximate solution to the problem through a mapping of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an -electron atom onto a contracted Schr\u00f6dinger equation (CSE) for an effective two-electron atom.

Ongoing projects range from metal-organic frameworks, to catalysis, to renewable energy, to nanomedicine. While addressing fundamental chemical problems, our research addresses crucial social issues, such as the environment and sustainability (catalysis and actinide sequestration); alternative renewable energy (solar fuels and biofuels); and human health (nanomedicine and metallopharmaceuticals). Our group pioneered the rational design of functional solids based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). We have designed a large number of MOFs and explored their applications in nonlinear optics, asymmetric catalysis, gas storage/separation, and solar energy utilization. Current efforts are particularly focused on using MOFs as single-site solid asymmetric catalysts, storage media for hydrogen and methane, and sensory materials; for gas separations and carbon dioxide capture; and for light-harvesting and photocatalysis. Catalysis is a major research effort that cuts across many different research directions. We are designing new highly enantioselective catalysts for a variety of organic transformations and applying our findings to solar and bioenergy generation. By taking advantage of our multidisciplinary expertise, we are not only discovering new homogeneous catalysts but also developing novel strategies for heterogenization of these relevant catalytic systems. To further improve these catalysts, we are interested in elucidating the mechanisms and fundamental issues concerning many of these interesting catalytic reactions. Our research in renewable energy targets three different forms of alternative energy: solar, biological, and nuclear. We are currently exploring new concepts for achieving artificial photosynthesis by integrating different functional components into hierarchically ordered molecular solids. We have developed strong expertise in light harvesting, water oxidation, and proton reduction. Our biofuel research involves designing new catalytic systems for efficient conversion of cheap, nonfood feedstocks to biofuels and increasing the performance of biofuels. Finally, our contributions to nuclear energy focus on developing novel sorbents for efficient extraction of uranium from seawater. By extracting uranium from seawater, which contains 1000 times more uranium than all terrestrial ores, we can ensure the availability of affordable, carbon-neutral power for many generations to come. We are developing hybrid nanomaterials (including nanoscale metal-organic frameworks, silicas, polysilsequioxanes, and degradable polymers) for biomedical imaging and drug delivery. We use the unique properties of nanoparticles to disproportionally accumulate in diseased tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect to actively target tumors. These nanoparticles combine the attractive features of both inorganic and organic materials, making them promising platforms for translation to the clinic. Ongoing research efforts include designing nanoscale multimodal imaging contrast agents (magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and optical imaging) for early diagnosis of cancers as well as targeted delivery of potent drugs for improved cancer therapy. Strong emphasis is placed on preclinical evaluations of these systems to enable their clinical translation.

While human hands can assemble two bricks in many different ways, however, chemists rely on the inherent reactivity of molecules to form chemical bonds. If a substrate has multiple similarly reactive sites, these will react competitively, and issues of site selectivity arise. If multiple substrates are present, any of these may react, and substrate specificity becomes a problem. There is no \u201chand\u201d to select which substrates or sites on those substrates react. Enzymes control reaction selectivity via substrate binding to enable biosynthetic sequences in complex biological milieu. The range of substrates and reactions compatible with enzymes, however, is limited relative to those developed by chemists. It is as if enzymes act as hands to link molecules together like Lego bricks, but only certain bricks and linkages are allowed. Research in the Lewis group focuses on evolving natural enzymes and engineering artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), hybrid catalysts comprised of synthetic metal cofactors linked to protein scaffolds, to overcome these fundamental limitations. The defined shapes, sizes, and dynamics of these catalyst systems allow them to manipulate molecules and reactivity in ways that conventional catalysts cannot. Because of this, they are well-suited to tackle complex selectivity problems, ranging from in vitro functionalization of biologically active molecules, to in vivo catalytic manipulation of cellular function and metabolic engineering. We are particularly focused on designing systems for site-selective C-H functionalization, which could save material, energy, and time during syntheses. Structural and biophysical characterization of these catalysts is informing the development of selective catalysts for a range of other transformations. Andorfer, M. C.; Park, H.

The elucidation of these interactions and the ability to examine and manipulate biomembranes that mimic real life systems hold the key to better understanding these diseases. Using microscopy and scattering techniques on two-dimensional monolayers and supported bilayers as model systems, we carry out fundamental studies on the interactions between lipids and proteins to gain a better understanding of respiratory distress syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Lung surfactant, a complex mixture of lipids and proteins, forms monolayers at the alveolar air-water interface. The surfactant lowers surface tension to almost zero and thus is responsible for reducing the work of breathing. A lack of surfactant, either due to immaturity in premature infants or disease or trauma in adults, can result in RDS. In spite of the serious morbidity and mortality of the disease, a firm understanding of the role of surfactant in both normal and diseased lungs does not yet exist. My group is interested in developing a detailed structure-function relationship for the various components of lung surfactant. In particular, we examine the phase behavior of various mixtures of lung surfactant components, as well as the interactions between lung surfactant-specific proteins and the surrounding lipid matrix. We specifically focus on the effects of lung surfactant proteins on monolayer collapse dynamics and the effects of serum proteins on the normal functioning of the lung surfactant. We hope to gain an understanding of the morphological consequences of monolayer phase separation and collapse, which is necessary for the continued development of positive interventions for patients suffering from RDS. A-beta, a self-assembling 39-43 residue peptide generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, comprises the major proteinaceous component of neuritic plaques and vascular deposits that appear in Alzheimer's disease and is implicated as one of the causal factors in the pathology of the disease. Since the Ab peptide fragment includes 28 residues just outside the membrane, in addition to the first 11-15 residues of the transmembrane domain, it has been shown to display properties common to surfactants. My group is interested in understanding the aggregation of the Ab peptides and in using two-dimensional thin films (either free-standing monolayers or supported bilayers) as templates to explore the possibility of surface-induced aggregation. We plan to study various isoforms of Ab and examine their surface activities and their association with model membrane systems in both their monomeric and aggregated states. This can elucidate the residue length dependence of the aggregation process and help explain why the longer Ab isoforms may be more intimately associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology than their shorter counterparts. Ab is also known to aggregate and form fibrils, though the mechanism involved is still not well understood. Since the rate of this process can be adjusted by various experimental parameters, we plan to monitor the formation process and characterize the structure of the fibrils formed. Our goal is to provide a model for Ab aggregation. Other research projects in our group include the insertion of antimicrobial peptide protegrin-1 into model membrane systems, structures and dynamics of monolayer and bilayer domains, membrane sealing using poloxamers, and two-dimensional ordering of rod-coil copolymers. Experimental techniques employed in these studies include optical and scanning probe microscopy as well as x-ray and neutron scattering. 1. Ordered Nanoclusters in Lipid/Cholesterol Membranes.

DNA nanodevices are nanoscale assemblies, formed from a collection of synthetic DNA strands, that can have artificial function engineered into them. We have created quantitative imaging technology that uses DNA nanodevices as fluorescent reporters to map second messengers in real time in cells and in vivo. Until our innovation, it was not at all obvious whether such DNA nanodevices could function inside a living cell without being interfered with, or interfering with, the cells own networks of DNA control. We have developed a range of strategies around this concept to interrogate diverse biological processes not previously amenable to analysis. We can now transform virtually any detection chemistry for various analytes into quantitative detection chemistries and localize that detection tissue-specifically in specific pre-designated subcellular locations in live organisms. Given the powerful ability to engineer a range of functionalities into DNA nanodevices, our lab seeks to create powerful biological imaging tools where none exist and unplug decades-old bottlenecks that have prevented quantitative measurements required to answer questions in systems biology. The versatile, functional imaging technology developed by us uses self-assembled DNA nanostructures to quantitatively image second messengers in real time, in living cells (1) and genetic model organisms (2). Why develop DNA nanodevices as fluorescent reporters when a range of fluorescent proteins exist? DNA is a modular scaffold, allowing the integration of independent and interdependent functionalities onto one assembly. By harnessing the modularity of DNA, we continuously develop two halves of a universal \" for specific analytes. It uses a DNA scaffold to display both (i) analyte detection chemistries and (ii) normalizing dyes to measure analyte concentration (3). The other half creates \" \" for specific organelles. Here, organelle trafficking motifs are incorporated onto DNA nanodevices to enable their localization in a designated area of the cell (4). Together the two halves now allow one to measure analyte concentrations with accuracies that were previously unattainable in subcellular locations that were previously inaccessible.

Such compounds function by directly modulating protein activity, providing a complementary approach to widely employed gene replacement and RNA interference strategies. While significant progress toward identifying compounds that regulate many cellular pathways has been made, developing potent and specific pharmacological probes remains an important and challenging endeavor. We employ two complementary strategies en route to an arsenal of new pharmacological agents. The first approach relies on natural products as a rich source of pharmacological probes for basic and translational biomedical research. We develop efficient chemical syntheses of such rare compounds and elucidation of their mechanism of action. We have developed a number of natural product analogs that potently and specifically target cytoskeletal organization, eukaryotic protein synthesis and bacterial transcription. The second approach relies on generating and screening new chemical libraries that mimic the structural diversity of secondary metabolome. We are using this strategy to identify an arsenal of new small-molecule tools to study altered energy metabolism in cancer. Due to the increased dependency of tumor cells on glycolysis and its likely role in promoting cell proliferation, survival and invasion, we seek to understand the nature of reprogrammed energy metabolism in cancer cells. Our study will help identify the underlying reasons for major alterations in energy producing pathways employed by rapidly proliferating cells and will test the possibility of targeting such cells selectively both The identification of new reactions expands our knowledge of chemical reactivity and enables new synthetic applications. Accelerating the pace of this discovery process remains challenging. We have been developing highly effective and simple platforms for screening a large number of potential chemical reactions in order to discover and optimize previously unknown catalytic transformations, thereby revealing new chemical reactivity. We have initially used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI\u2013TOF\u2013MS) to analyse chemical transformations on the surface of self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on gold. Despite the high throughput of the primary reaction screen and its ability to detect products with unanticipated structures, subsequent translation of the initially identified interfacial reactions to preparative, solution-phase processes have often required substantial effort. To address this problem, we developed a new reaction-discovery strategy that features not only excellent screening throughput, but also a highly efficient translation of the initial \u2018hits\u2019 into catalytic, synthetically useful transformations. The reactions are rapidly analysed in solution using label-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LA\u2013LDI\u2013TOF\u2013MS). This simple and highly effective approach is based on the incorporation of a readily available polyaromatic tag into the structure of a reactant, thereby greatly facilitating the desorption/ionization process and enabling rapid and selective MS analysis of hundreds of chemical reactions in solution under matrix-free conditions with excellent efficiency. After validation of the concept by monitoring the course of several known transformations, the technology was used to evaluate the outcome of 696 different reactant combinations, and led to the discovery of two previously unknown benzannulations.

To that end, we develop novel methods for the total synthesis of proteins that enable us to apply advanced physical methods in unprecedented ways to understand the chemical origins of protein structure and function. We then demonstrate that knowledge by the design and construction of protein molecules with novel properties. The Kent research group pioneered modern chemical ligation methods for the total synthesis of protein molecules. The long polypeptide chains of proteins are prepared by chemoselective reaction of unprotected peptide segments that contain unique, mutually reactive functional groups (\u2018chemical ligation\u2019). The most powerful ligation chemistry is thioester-mediated, amide-forming ligation at Xaa-Cys sites, termed \u2018native chemical ligation\u2019. The resulting polypeptide chains are then folded with great efficiency to give high purity synthetic proteins. The covalent structure of the synthetic protein is confirmed by mass spectrometry, and its three dimensional folded structure is determined by high resolution X-ray crystallography. Synthetic proteins have full biochemical and biological activities. Chemical protein synthesis is generally applicable to the efficient preparation of polypeptide chains containing 300 or more amino acids. Total synthesis enables the versatile incorporation of non-coded amino acids into proteins, and the modification and labeling of protein molecules without restriction as to the sites, numbers, and kinds of chemical moieties being introduced. The chemical synthesis approach enables us to make mirror image \u2018D-protein\u2019 molecules not found in nature. We have pioneered the use of racemic protein crystallography to determine the X-ray structures of proteins that otherwise will not crystallize, and to obtain protein electron density maps of unprecedented accuracy. In collaboration with Sachdev Sidhu (Toronto) we prototyped the use of mirror image protein targets prepared by total chemical synthesis, to identify novel lead molecules from phage-displayed protein libraries. Synthesis of the enantiomer of the identified protein binders gives unique D-protein molecules, which could not have been discovered using the natural target, that have the specificity and potency of antibodies and that are effective against the natural target protein. The resulting D-protein therapeutic candidates are non-immunogenic, non-toxic, resistant to natural proteases, and long-lived in vivo.

An example of these efforts has been the development of tungsten\u2013alkylidyne photoredox chromophores that photosensitize the transfer of protons and electrons from H The synthesis on planar surfaces of 3D supramolecular structures with controlled dimensions offers unique opportunities to precisely position nanoscale and molecular functional modules at addressable interfaces. We are studying the surface chemistry of metalloporphyrins and related molecules in which axial ligands support functional units such as dyes, redox shuttles, and supramolecular receptors, positioning them at specific Cartesian coordinates within the array. An example of this approach is the discovery of gallium(III) porphyrin monolayers that induce the spontaneous self assembly of organized fullerene arrays on graphite under ambient conditions. These hybrid materials are readily extensible to other 2D surfaces formed by graphene and gold, and have potential applications in solar energy conversion, sensing, and catalysis. Materials based on \u03c0-conjugated organic oligomers and polymers have important applications in solar cell, sensor, and display technologies. One of our goals is to develop metal-containing analogues of conjugated organic materials, in which selected multiply bonded carbon atoms are replaced by metal centers. These centers enhance the optical and redox properties of the hybrid materials and provide new loci for controlling their electronic structures. We have prepared novel \u03c0-conjugated compounds from building blocks that contain M\u2013M and M\u2013L multiple bonds and explored how their bonding, structures, and properties compare with organic counterparts. Tungsten-containing oligo-phenylene-ethynylenes, for example, maintain the electronic delocalization of organic OPEs but possess enhanced optical and redox properties that are inaccessible to their organic analogues. \"Thermodynamic and Structural Factors that Influence the Redox Potentials of Tungsten-Alkylidyne Complexes.\" B.

We discovered the first RNA demethylase and continue to explore gene expression regulation mediated by dynamic and reversible RNA modifications such as A. We developed enabling tools to map DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and its oxidation derivatives in mammalian genomes and continue to study DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidation and demethylation in biological regulation. We revealed the presence of DNA 6-methyladenosine (6mA) in eukaryotic genomes and continue to investigate functional roles played by this new DNA mark in eukaryotes. We study virulence and antibiotic resistance regulation in human pathogens. We also study metal ion homeostasis and selective metal ion recognition by naturally occurring and engineered proteins. Cellular RNAs contain more than a hundred structurally distinct post-transcriptional modifications at thousands of sites. Some RNA modifications are dynamic and may have critical regulatory roles analogous to those of protein and DNA modifications. Understanding the scope and mechanisms of dynamic RNA modifications thus represents an emerging research frontier in biology and medicine. The internal A) modification in messenger RNA is one of the most abundant RNA modifications in eukaryotes. This base modification is present on average in 3-5 sites of every mRNA in mammals. Deletion of this ubiquitous modification leads to apoptosis in mammalian cells and arrested development of plant cells. Yet, the functional roles of m6A in mRNA had never been elucidated. A in mammalian mRNA can be oxidatively demethylated in vitro and inside cells by FTO (a fat mass and obesity-associated protein), a major obesity factor, as the first known RNA demethylase. We subsequently identified ALKBH5 as the second RNA demethylase that controls mammalian spermatogenesis. These and other results from our laboratory indicate the presence of a new mode of regulation through reversible RNA methylation in mammalian cells, which we plan to establish as a new paradigm of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. : Our recent work has identified the YTH family proteins as the reader proteins that specifically bind methylated RNA transcripts in mammalian cells. Functional characterizations revealed that YTHDF2 affects cytoplasmic localization and mediates the decay of methylated mRNA, YTHDF1 promotes translation of methylated mRNA by facilitating translation initiation, and other readers affect mRNA storage, transport, and cellular localization. Some of these proteins play essential roles in animal development and human diseases. Just like the interplay between DNA cytosine-methylation and methyl-CpG-binding proteins that regulate gene expression through binding to methylated cytosines, these reader proteins recognize m A and mediate resultant biological functions. We continue to uncover the physiological significance of the mRNA methylation in various cell differentiation and development events and their underlying mechanisms. : We have identified a core complex comprised of two catalytically active subunits: METTL3 and METTL14, and an accessory factor WTAP, which mediates cellular m6A RNA methylation. Our current work focuses on how the methylation selectivity is achieved. DNA is not merely a combination of four genetic nucleobases, namely, A, T, C, and G. It also contains modifications that play crucial roles throughout biology. For example, 5-methylcytosine(5mC), the fifth DNA base which is a crucial epigenetic mark, constitutes ~2-8% of the total cytosines in human genomic DNA and impacts a broad range of biological functions. Recently, the presence of oxidized 5mC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine(5caC), have been discovered in mammalian cells and tissues as the sixth, seventh, and eighth DNA bases. A group of iron(II)/\u03b1KG-dependent dioxygenases, the TET proteins, have been shown to utilize dioxygen to oxidize 5mC to these new base modifications in the mammalian genome. We have developed effective sequencing technologies (TAB-seq and hmC-Seal) to map their precise locations and dissect the exact functional roles of these newly discovered DNA base modifications. We are also exploring these new DNA marks as potential disease markers. Although 5mC and 6mA were discovered as DNA methylations at almost the same time decades ago, most research has been dedicated to 5mC for its abundant presence in mammals and higher plants. We have recently found that 6mA displays a unique distribution pattern in several unicellular eukaryotic organisms. 6mA marks transcription start sites (TSS) and exhibits a periodicity that marks the linker regions between adjacent nucleosomes. This new DNA mark has also been found to exist in high eukaryotes including animals. We are currently actively exploring functional roles of 6mA in the eukaryotic genomes. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are human pathogens responsible for most wound and nosocomial infections. We study virulence regulation pathways in these pathogens. Our ultimate goal is to develop new strategies for treating infections. The ability to regulate essential or toxic metal ion concentrations is critical for cell survival. We have developed a small molecule that blocks copper trafficking inside mammalian cells through binding to the copper-trafficking proteins. The treatment with this small molecule selectively inhibits the growth and proliferation of several types of human cancer cells in animal models. We have also been working on understanding how specific metal ions are recognized and regulated in biological systems. We have elucidated the mechanisms of proteins that exhibit remarkable selectivity toward metal ions such as lead(II), cadmium(II), gold(I), copper(I), and iron(II). Some of these proteins can be converted into genetically encoded fluorescent probes for subcellular metal ion imaging in live cells. We also work on engineering proteins that possess high sensitivity and selectivity toward various metal ions including actinides, and developing probes for the imaging of cellular small molecules.

This is where chemistry excels and where physics predicts that many properties can be tuned. For example, quantum states, charging, spin, phonons, and plasmons show dramatic effects at this scale. Colloidal synthesis enables the construction of nanostructures by chemical precipitation. Our research is therefore driven by physical concepts and enabled by synthesis. Nanocrystals of semiconductor materials show very strong quantum confinement effects, and controlling their size leads to exquisite tuning of energy levels. Our group works on the effect of small additions of charges, i.e., quantum dot ions, on the optical, magnetic, and electronic properties. We synthesize semiconductor nanocrystals and control their sizes and their surfaces. We then use microscopy and nonlinear spectroscopy to study basic aspects of electron dynamics and interaction in such strongly confined structures. We currently focus on the doping of nanocrystals, their unusual infrared response, their electrochromic effects, as well as the potentially novel electrical transport properties in films made of these artificial atoms. As the potential is more reducing (-), electrons are added to the CdSe quantum dots. The conductance of a film of dots (red line) first increases linearly with the occupation of the 1S orbital (dashed blue line), up to \u00bd filling, at which point it decreases. The conductance then increases again as the 1P shell (dashed green line) occupation increases. Shell occupation is controlled by the electrochemical potential and measured by the optical absorption of the sample. Metal objects of small dimensions relative to their optical wavelength exhibit strong optical responses because of the collective excitation of all the valence electrons in the plasmon particle. Its resonance frequency is tightly determined by its shape, and its width is determined by losses due to scattering of the electrons. Because of these properties, gold and silver work well due to their high chemical stability. Since resonance is an effect of shape rather than size, optimizing colloidal synthesis to yield a specific shape is one goal. Needle shaped nanostructures are particularly advantageous, as they allow the external electric field to focus at very high values. Our research aims to observe the maximum effect of very large local fields on the photoresponse of individual nanoparticles and assemblies. Solutions of gold and gold/silver core/shell colloids exhibit very different colors, effectively covering the visible spectrum. This is not a quantum effect, but rather a collective electronic resonance determined by the shape of the metal particles.

Excited states in the condensed phase have an extremely high chemical potential, thereby making them highly reactive and difficult to control. Our control strategy involves exploiting coherent response of the environment to the excitation event. In particular, we develop methodologies to manipulate two fundamental components of excited state dynamics: exciton migration and non-radiative relaxation. Our approach is inspired by biological systems optimized by evolution to exploit manifestly quantum mechanical phenomena to drive coherent energy transfer, to steer trajectories through conical intersections and to protect long-lived quantum coherence. Currently, we are focusing on four key scientific efforts: (1) new techniques to image excited state dynamics, (2) understanding mechanisms of quantum transport in photosynthesis, (3) dynamics of conical intersections in the condensed phase, and (4) engineering quantum dynamics in new classes of synthetic materials. Excited state dynamics prove extremely sensitive to couplings to the environment and to other electronic states. Such subtle couplings in complex excitonic systems require new spectroscopic approaches to collect data and new strategies to interpret spectra. We have created the first optical analog to MRI by recasting the electronic spectroscopy problem into an imaging problem. Our GRAPE approach can capture the entire 2D spectrum in a single laser shot. We plan to use this technique to study photodamage, oxidative aging, and photoprotection to understand how these processes affect electronic structure. The discovery of long-lived quantum coherence and coherence transport in photosynthetic systems has spawned interest in \"Quantum Biology\" \u2013 aspects of biology where evolution has taken advantage of non-classical phenomena. The inclusion of a wavelike mechanism of energy transfer provides an opportunity for robust and efficient operation in disordered environments and represents a new paradigm for transport in materials. The Engel group endeavors to understand design principles evident in photosynthetic light harvesting and then to incorporate these elements into synthetic systems. We maintain an active research program in biophysics that allows us to probe the mechanism and to develop new characterization methods. We have isolated a new signature in our 2D data that provides direct evidence of quantum transport. The first observation of its type, we discovered population oscillations due to the protein bath coupling population (diagonal) elements of the density matrix to oscillatory coherence (off-diagonal) elements of the matrix. This observation suggests an opportunity to engineer chemical consequences of quantum coherence, such as oscillatory reaction rates, into synthetic systems. The Engel Group is developing small-molecule test Cases for long-lived coherence. We strive to maintain control over the relative dipole orientations, the solvation environment (solution, polymer, glass, etc), and the energetics of the coupling. To this end, we have synthesized functionalized fluorescein molecules and linked them together to form dimeric pairs. Our synthetic scheme is specifically designed to tune properties related to coherent energy transfer such as distance, coupling, dipolar orientation, and stiffness. The synthetic strategy outlined here can also be easily modified to give similar compounds with rotated transition dipoles, different transition energy gaps, different distances between chromophores and different numbers of chromophores (dimers, trimers, etc). Phenomenological environmentally-assisted quantum transport (EnAQT) models explain the benefits of coherent transport. However, these models lack the detail required to enable new excitonic materials that operate with this mechanism. We are exploring new models of coherent energy transport to isolate design principles that will enable new quantum materials. Our efforts include advances in both theory and analysis. For example, different pairs of excitons show radically different dephasing times and these dephasing times do not directly correlate to energy, spatial overlap or distance. To extract this data, we adapted the Z-transform and applied it to two-dimensional spectra for the first time. This new analysis tool permits simultaneous extraction of decay constants and beating frequencies. Also, we found that experiments were probing the ensemble dephasing of the photosynthetic complexes, but that the efficiency of transport depends not on the dephasing time, but on the decoherence time. That is, inhomogeneity across the ensemble leads to dephasing, but transport efficiency depends only on the system-bath interactions within each complex. These observations led us to develop new approaches to separate experimentally dephasing from decoherence using the rephasing nature of 2D electronic spectroscopy. A main goal of our laboratory remains probing and controlling reactivity near conical intersections in the condensed phase. Photochemistry has proven very difficult to understand and to intuit in solution because trajectories through conical intersections typically depend on solvent coordinates in the condensed phase (22,23). Within photoenzymes, motion along these coordinates can be precisely controlled, but in solution, it is random. Ultimately, we aim to manipulate macromolecular scaffolds to affect excited state reactivity near conical intersections. The critical control parameters for such a strategy are the non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling elements that mix the two electronic states and that determine the trajectories through the conical intersection. Yet, no spectroscopy exists that can dissect these coupling elements. We are working to create a new spectroscopic technique to directly image these couplings. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy often fails to resolve the underlying Hamiltonian fully or to provide a complete map of the excited state dynamics. We strive to develop novel and tractable higher order spectroscopic methods to better isolate specific signals. Extending the capabilities of our 2D electronic spectroscopy into three (or more) dimensions reveals additional information and exploits the improved phase stability and acquisition speed of our GRAPE spectrometer. Expanding on the 3D idea, we realized that we can apply some of the same analysis strategy to our third order spectra. By eliminating exponential population dynamics and subsequently examining long-lived coherences, we have resolved 19 individual cross-peaks to enable extraction of the Hamiltonian (Figure 9). In contrast, the 2D electronic spectrum (Figure 4, inset) shows only a single resolvable cross-peak, which the 3D experiment shows to be actually composed of two cross-peaks. This work provides a new paradigm for dissecting excitonic Hamiltonians in highly congested spectra. A.F. Fidler, V.P. Singh, P.D. Long, P.D. Dahlberg, and G.S.

Our effort is in three broad areas: Because the defining properties of life (growth, movement, and directed response to environmental stimuli) rely on irreversible energy consumption and dissipation, much of our research centers on the statistics of stochastic systems far from equilibrium. This is an exciting time in this area as basic principles have emerged over the last two decades, and there is now the opportunity to explore how they apply in real systems in order to realize their potential for designing and interpreting experiments. To this end, my group and I are working to develop phenomenological models in close collaboration with researchers acquiring data amenable to quantitative analysis (e.g., cellular images, expression levels, forces). We have worked on cytoskeletal, circadian, and developmental problems in reconstituted systems with purified components, cell lines, bacteria, flies, and mice. One feature that makes studies of biological behavior challenging is that the relevant dynamics span a hierarchy of time and length scales ranging from \u00c5ngstroms and femtoseconds to millimeters and days. Experiments are now beginning to bridge the gaps in spatial and temporal resolution, and models are vital for design and interpretation of such measurements. Corresponding simulations require methods that can increase exploration of states that are rarely visited in comparison with the time scale of molecular fluctuations (e.g., transition states) while still enabling recovery of unbiased statistical averages. We developed some of the most general and efficient methods available for accelerating the convergence of properties of microscopically irreversible models (nonequilibrium umbrella sampling and steered transition path sampling); we are now working with applied mathematicians to analyze these methods rigorously to improve and extend them. Additionally, we are exploring dimensional reduction techniques (i.e., automated methods for identifying physically informative reaction coordinates in complex systems) to aid in interpreting simulations and connecting them with experimental observables. Extensive data from high throughput (e.g., genome-wide) experiments are now available for many biological systems, but it remains unclear how best to use this information to formulate mechanistic and predictive models. We introduced, validated, and deployed the first approach for combining binding and expression measurements to identify long-range (in DNA sequence) gene regulatory targets of transcription factor binding events (EMBER: Expectation Maximization of Binding and Expression pRofiles). We continue to investigate methods for integrating diverse types of data for better elucidation of molecular interactions. 1. Ma, A. & Dinner, A. R.

Our approach is to build functional molecules, both small molecules, peptides, and entire enzymes, to solve problems in biomedical science. Currently, the group is focused on three primary project areas: Although hundreds of proteins in the human proteome are subjected to regulation by lysine and cysteine acylation, the regulation of these modifications is largely unknown. Therefore, we are developing tools to uncover how cells regulate deacylation and other \u201ceraser\u201d activities, and how these modifications regulate signaling. Our approach is to develop small molecule fluorescent imaging reagents that report on the \u201cerasers\u201d of lysine and cysteine PTMs. For example, hundreds of human proteins are modified by reversible palmitoylation of cysteine residues (S-palmitoylation), but the regulation and dynamics of depalmitoylation in cells is poorly understood. We recently developed DPPs, small molecule fluorescent probes to monitor the endogenous activity levels of \u201cerasers\u201d of S-palmitoylation, acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs). Live-cell analysis with DPPs revealed rapid growth factor-mediated inhibition of the depalmitoylation activity of APTs, exposing a novel regulatory mechanism of dynamic lipid signaling. Ultimately, we are driven to uncover how chemical modifications to the proteome are regulated, with a particular focus on dynamic subcellular trafficking. We are pioneering a new approach for both bioanalysis the cellular engineering that utilizes activity-responsive RNA polymerases (ARs) as a new family of easily programmable biosensors. We recently unveiled protease-responsive RNAPs (PRs) as a strategy to respond to protease activities by production of defined RNA outputs, and showed that PRs can encode multidimensional protease activities in defined sequences of RNA in both prokaryotic and mammalian cells. RNAPs in principle provide a new platform for biosensor creation, but engineering such complex enzymes is challenging. Therefore, we used evolution to create a proximity-dependent \u201csplit\u201d RNAP as a versatile biosensor platform. We have now generated split RNAP-based AR sensors for small molecules, protein-protein interactions, light, catalytic processes, and more, with robust sensitivity and dynamic range (>300-fold). We are deploying ARs as new synthetic biology tools to control genetic therapies, to create biosensing platforms to analyze endogenous (bio)chemical processes using high-throughput sequencing, and to develop new rapid evolution platforms to reprogram biomolecules and small molecule therapies. All genetic information contained within the DNA of living systems is carried through an intermediate RNA biopolymer prior to conversion to protein. Recently, a variety of RNA chemical modifications have been discovered, opening up the new field of epitranscriptomics. However, an inability to accurately measure and manipulate specific chemical marks on specific RNAs has impeded the elucidation of the biological roles of these clearly important modifications. Therefore, we are developing new evolution and protein-engineering approaches that will allow us to develop tools to site-specifically chemically modify RNA regulatory mechanisms on single target RNAs in live cells. Our versatile technologies will lay down the framework for the comprehensive analysis of RNA post-transcriptional regulation, shifting the paradigm for how genetic information flow is regulated in mammalian systems.

To experimentally probe the detailed molecular dynamics, both nuclear and electronic, during a chemical reaction, we use a combination of molecular beam reactive scattering and laser spectroscopic techniques. Traditionally, predicting rate constants and microscopic dynamics has relied on statistical transition state theories or, in smaller systems, quantum scattering calculations on a single adiabatic potential energy surface that provides the barriers to each reaction. However, a reaction evolves on a single potential energy surface only if the Born Oppenheimer separation of nuclear and electronic motion is valid. Much of our recent work investigates classes of important chemical reactions where the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (the inability of the electronic wavefunction to readjust rapidly enough during the nuclear dynamics) near the transition state alters the dynamics and markedly reduces the reaction rate. The studies test the predictions of emerging quantum theories on nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in small systems and develop an intuitive framework for understanding chemical reaction dynamics in more complex organic and inorganic reactions not yet accessible to precise quantum calculations. As an example, our recent work on nitric acid and other important atmospheric species seeks to understand from first principles quantum mechanics why some chemical products are produced and not others. In the photodissociation of nitric acid two chemical bonds may break, producing OH+NO and HONO+O respectively. The ability of the electronic wavefunction to change along the reaction coordinate, particularly the orientation of the radical OH p electron's orbital, plays a critical role in determining what products are formed. Our early molecular beam experiments showed that nonadiabatic recrossing of the transition state plays a dominant role in determining the branching between chemical bond fission channels, reversing the expected branching between C-Br and C-Cl fission in the Br(CH COCl. Suppressing rapid intramolecular electronic energy transfer allows you to preferentially cleave a selected chemical bond. Our experiments and supporting ab initio calculations elucidate the intramolecular distance and conformation dependence of nonadiabatic recrossing of the reaction barriers in the competing reaction channels. Other experiments use molecular photodissociation to directly access both the upper and lower adiabatic potential energy surfaces, respectively, near the transition state region of a excited state bimolecular reaction to probe the influence of nonadiabatic coupling in chemical reaction dynamics. Our molecular beam photofragmentation and emission spectroscopy experiments and collaborative theoretical work on CH +SH reactive potential energy surfaces changes the branching between the S-H and C-S bond fission channels and how nonadiabatic coupling influences the dynamics. In this system and in H S, we used the technique of emission spectroscopy of dissociating molecules to investigate the dynamics which occurs during the subpicosecond dissociation event, providing a key link between the absorption spectrum and the final product quantum states. We have recently introduced a method for investigating the competing unimolecular dissociation channels of isomerically-selected radicals as a function of internal energy in the radical. Radical intermediates play a key role in a wide range of chemical processes, yet many key isomeric radical intermediates elude direct experimental probes. Our experiments photolytically produce from an appropriate precursor a selected radical isomer and disperse the radicals by their neutral velocity imparted in the photolysis, thus dispersing them by internal energy. For the unstable radicals, they then measure the branching between C-C and C-H fission products via tunable VUV photoionization of products dispersed by their velocity. This offers the unprecedented ability to measure the branching between isomeric product channels as a function of internal energy in the dissociating radical isomer on the ground state potential energy surface.

With this motivation, we explore the excited-state electronic structure \u2013 including the emergence and behavior of excitons \u2013 as well as the concomitant quantum dynamics responsible for energy transfer and complex spectroscopic signals.

Mammalian gene expression is under tight regulation temporally and spatially, which contributes to the formation of different cell types, tissues, and organs. Gene regulation involves a complex network of players, including multiple DNA, RNA sequence elements and RNA and protein factors. These regulators interact with each other and carry out combinatorial regulatory functions. Our lab uses both computational and experimental approaches to study the biology of gene regulation from a systems point of view. Our current focus pertains to the regulation of gene expression at the RNA level via the process of pre-mRNA splicing and other post-transcriptional (or co-transcriptional) mechanisms. Splicing is a critical step enabling diversity in gene expression programs. More than 90% of all human genes undergo alternative splicing which allows multiple gene products with potentially different functions to be produced from a single gene locus. We are currently investigating splicing regulatory mechanisms using comparative genomics, high-throughput technologies, such as deep sequencing and microarrays, and systems level computational analysis, such as system identification and modeling approaches. A long-term goal of our research is to better understand the involvement of splicing in gene expression programs of different disease models.

By applying this targeted gene-expression approach to molecular imaging, metastatic lesions were detected in living tumor-bearing mice. Transcriptional targeted approaches are being developed to express the different therapeutic genes and imaging genes in prostate and breast cancer models. In a second strategy, we are exploiting the distributive property of the adenovirus and use it to investigate tumor vasculatures and cancer metastasis. As a third strategy, the viral replication property is usurped to create cancer-specific lysis. Molecular imaging techniques such as optical CCD imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) are fundamental tools of our investigation.

Exploring the mechanisms through which the immune system can modulate skeletal muscle wasting, injury, regeneration and growth is a particular focus of the lab. Discoveries in the Tidball lab over the past 20 years have shown that immune cells, especially myeloid cells, play a major role in modulating muscle injury and repair that occur in chronic, muscle wasting diseases and following acute injuries. For example, their findings have shown that macrophages and eosinophils are key effector cells in the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Ongoing investigations in the lab are revealing the identity of specific molecules released by myeloid cells that promote muscular dystrophy. However, recent findings in the lab have also shown that regulatory interactions between cytotoxic, M1 macrophages in dystrophic muscle and anti-inflammatory, M2a macrophages are important in regulating the balance between the death of dystrophic muscle and regenerative processes. This work shows that the experimental manipulation of the balance between the functions of M1 and M2a macrophages can affect the severity of muscular dystrophy, suggesting that manipulation of macrophage phenotype in vivo may have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of the disease. Other investigations in the Tidball lab concern the proteolytic mechanisms that contribute to sarcopenia, the process through which muscle wasting occurs during the aging process. The Tidball lab uses proteomic approaches to identify specific, key substrates in proteolytic cascades that lead to muscle wasting. Subsequent experimentation relies on genetic manipulations designed to disrupt the cascades, with the goal of reducing sarcopenia. Identification of the mechanisms through which pro-inflammatory, Th1 cytokines can modulate muscle wasting during aging by influencing the state of activation proteases that drive muscle wasting is also major component of the sarcopenia investigations in the Tidball lab.

In contrast to conventional bench-top setups, microfluidics has been used to manipulate chemical and biological processes on nanoliter (nL) to microliter (mL) scales with the profound advantages of enhanced heat transfer performance, faster diffusion time and reaction kinetics, as well as improved control over experimental conditions. By incorporating integrated microvalves into microfluidic batch systems, the integrated microfluidic platforms enable the execution and automation of multiple, parallel, and/or sequential chemical or biological processes on a single chip under digital control. For the past two years, we have been working with several research groups who have expertise covering molecular imaging, cancer biology, immunology and pathology to develop a variety of functioning microfluidic platforms for applications in three major areas of interest: In a boarder playing field, our goal remains the creation of further integrated microfluidic technology platforms for the broader space in chemistry and biology beyond a single functioning platform on a chip. We will compile many different microfluidic platforms to produce a number of game systems: \"Let's Play _____\", where the blank is \"systems biology of disease\", \"biomarkers\", \"pharmacology\", \"biochemical reaction kinetics\", \"chemistry\" and \"cancer diagnosis\" etc. where execution is rapid and learning curves are steep.

My research interests span several important areas of bioengineering and reaction engineering. Applied mathematics, computer simulations, video microscopy, and digital image processing are integral parts of my research methodology. TISSUE ENGINEERING: The proliferation and migration of anchorage-dependent mammalian cells are important processes for many biomedical applications. Using video microscopy, digital image analysis and computer simulations, my group is studying the mechanisms through which cell migration and proliferation affect the growth of three-dimensional tissues. Experimental data and model predictions are used to analyze the dynamic behavior of large cell populations proliferating on three-dimensional scaffolds and find how tissue growth rates are modulated by the presence of growth factors in the culture media, cell-substrate interactions, the spatial distribution of seed cells, the heterogeneity of cell populations and the specific tissue architecture. The objective of these studies is the development of a suite of experimental and computational tools that allow accurate predictions of tissue growth rates using only a few key measurements. MECHANICAL FORCES AND CELL FUNCTION: Our research in this area focuses on elucidating the effect of mechanical forces on the biochemical pathways of lymphocyte adhesion and migration. We have recently demonstrated that lymphocytes cultured in low-shear bioreactors (rotating wall vessel or RWV reactors) exhibit similar adhesion strength but higher motility than lymphocytes cultured under static conditions (i.e on standard tissue culture plates). Using NMR and image analysis techniques, we are investigating the hypothesis that these motility changes are modulated by prolonged stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) occurring via phosphatidylcholine (PC) cycles that generate second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG). We are also extending our studies to include lymphocytes exposed to high-shear conditions in cone-and-plate or rotating plate viscometers. Identification of the pathways involved in the observed cell motility changes will have significant implications for space biology (i.e. eadverse effects of microgravity on the human immune system) and may help us understand the beneficial effects of RWV culture for tissue engineering applications. CATALYTIC REACTORS FOR AIR POLLUTION CONTROL: We are working to develop integrated computer simulation and visualization tools for the optimal design of emission control reactors that incorporate some the most advanced adsorption and catalytic reaction technologies. Computer simulation is essential for the application of these technologies because of the complex interactions of transport, adsorption, heterogeneous reaction and catalyst deactivation phenomena occurring in emission control reactors. Optimization tools are also incorporated in our codes to allow for easy determination of optimal values of process parameters. These simulators will move computer-aided design into the hands of reactor engineers, so that they can meet the air pollution control challenges in small and medium-size operations GAS-SOLID AND LIQUID-SOLID REACTIONS: Our research in this area focuses on the dynamic behavior of gas-solid or liquid-solid reacting systems with temporally evolving structures. Theoretical and experimental studies are carried out to determine which structural and process parameters control (a) the reactivity of porous carbonaceous materials and (b) the release rates of bioactive agents from multicomponent bioerodible systems. Video microscopy and digital image processing facilities support the experimental studies on coal pyrolysis and combustion. Our primary objective here is the analysis of transient phenomena such as coal particle swelling, macropore formation and heterogeneous or homogeneous ignitions. This information is then used to develop theoretical models that can guide thel design of coal utilization processes.

My research interests span several important areas of bioengineering and reaction engineering. Applied mathematics, computer simulations, video microscopy, and digital image processing are integral parts of my research methodology. Tissue growth in biomimetic scaffolds is strongly influenced by the dynamics and the heterogeneity of cell populations. A significant source of heterogeneity is the depletion of nutrients and growth factors due to transport limitations. Cells slow down, stop dividing or even die when the concentrations of key nutrients and growth factors drop below certain levels in the scaffold interior. As a result, tissue engineers have not yet been able to grow in vitro tissue samples thicker than a few millimeters for metabolically active cells. In order to better understand these processes, my group is developing a multi-scale, hybrid framework that integrates biology with mathematical, computational, and experimental tools to study heterogeneous cell populations growing in three-dimensional scaffolds. We use a discrete, stochastic model to describe the population dynamics of migrating, interacting and proliferating cells. The diffusion and consumption of nutrients and growth factors are modeled by partial differential equations that are subject to boundary conditions appropriate for the bioreactors used in each case. These PDEs are solved numerically and the computed concentration profiles are fed to receptor-mediated binding/trafficking models or simplified kinetic expressions (i.e. Monod kinetics) to modulate cell proliferation rates and migration speeds. To meet the significant computational requirements of this model, parallel implementations of the hybrid algorithms have been developed for Linux clusters. Finally, video microscopy and digital image analysis are used to experimentally observe the dynamic behavior of cell populations and find how cell migration and proliferation are influenced by the concentrations of nutrients and growth factors in the culture media, as well as by cell-substrate interactions.

My previous work has used live-cell signaling assays to show that the dynamics of the TGF-beta signaling pathway are adaptive and to explore the consequences of this discovery for the function of TGFbeta as a patterning signal. I have also used micropatterning technology to develop in vitro systems for studying pattern formation. In particular, I have demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) confined to micropatterns during differentiation form self-organized patterns containing all three germ layers and reminiscent of those in mammalian embryos. Current projects include: using live-cell reporters of both signaling and fate in micropatterned culture to dissect the mechanisms of pattern formation, manipulating the shape of the micropatterned constraint to understand the relationship between geometry and cell fate, and developing three-dimensional culture systems that more completely mimic embryonic development. Ideas and tools developed for the study of embryonic development are also being deployed to understand the role of signaling dynamics and the relationship between healthy and diseased cells in the cancer microenvironment.

Our biochemical research is focused on: (i) investigating if a protein\u2019s mutational tolerance reports on its functionally important motions, (ii) using structure-guided protein recombination to understand sequence-structure-function relationships within protein complexes, and (iii) understanding the regulation Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. Our synthetic biology research is focused on: (iv) developing new methods for laboratory evolution that accelerate our ability to overcome component limitations, (v) building new enzyme technologies for increasing spatial and temporal control over metabolic labeling, and (vi) establishing reporters for biosensing in hard-to-image conditions, e.g., animals, biochars, and soils. Our expertise in biochemistry and biomolecular design puts us in a unique position to study living systems, as we take advantage of classical methods for biochemical inquiry and develop and apply novel biotechnologies to support these lines of research. Our philosophy is that transformative advances occur when biochemical studies are extended to conditions that reflect those within living cells and the environment, and important synthetic biology advances occur when experimental observations can be anticipated using physical models.

Biomechanical Model-Based Deformable Registration: In 2003, I developed a research program focused on the development of a novel deformable modeling technique using biomechanical models and finite element analysis, Morfeus. The technique, which is substantially different than the widely available deformable image registration algorithms that rely on image intensity, incorporates the biomechanical properties of tissues to model the complex interaction of neighboring tissues and tumors. The application has been tested and validated on a number of anatomical sites including head and neck, lung, breast, esophagus, liver, pancreas, stomach, cervix, prostate, and rectum. This has expanded to include modeling of tissue response to radiation, applications in small animals, and generation of 3D or 4D models from limited data. 2. Dose Reconstruction: The development of Morfeus, the biomechanical model-based deformable registration algorithm, has enabled investigations into the reconstruction of a more accurate calculation of the dose delivered to the tumor and surrounding normal tissue over the course of treatment. With the use of accurate deformable registration, the impact of breathing motion, tissue deformation, and tissue volume changes on the delivered dose has been investigated retrospectively to enable intelligent design of prospective clinical trials to adapt to these changes. 3. Correlative Pathology: The use of deformable registration to integrate multi-modality images has raised the question of which imaging modality, or combination correctly identifies the tumor boundary? I have developed a research program in correlative pathology (deformable registration between histology and in vivo images) to investigate this issue. To understand the changes in the material properties during fixation, I have also begun to research the application of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). The MRE research has also enabled an additional research focus on small animal imaging and intervention to evaluate radiation and drug response, which will improve our understanding of these complex changes for applications in human clinical studies.", "tag": "peer"},

By 2050, this number will increase to 14 million unless a cure is found. Finding novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease represents a challenge that will involve different scientific disciplines. Our approach involves the use of molecular scissors to degrade and solubilize amyloid deposits. These amyloid scissors consist of a recognition element capable of selectively binding to amyloid plaques, bound to an artificial protease capable of cleave proteins, similar to those in amyloid plaques. We also aim to attach paramagnetic species such as gadolinium compounds to amyloid recognition elements for use as diagnosis tools in conjuction with MRI techniques. Other projects involve the design of probes for the detection and monitoring of DNA and mRNA in different media. This will include the use of hybridization probes with an oligonucleotide sequence complementary to the target sequence of interest, and a fluorescent reporter group capable of changing its photophysical properties upon binding to the target sequence. Our group is also interested in investigating the changes in structure that the protein alpha-synuclein undergoes when it binds to membranes and small molecules such as melanin. Alpha-synuclein has been associated with the pathology of Parkinson's disease. We will use spectroscopic methods such as FTIR and circular dichroism to determine the changes in structure of this protein when interacting with different molecular and supramolecular agents.

{"name": "Ron Martin", "department": "Geography", "university": "University of Cambridge", "profile_link": "https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/martin/", "position": "Professor", "phd_year": "Unknown", "phd_school": "Unknown", "promotion_year": 2016, "text_raw": "Distinguished Speaker Lecture, International Conference on 'The Changing Geography of Money, Banking and Finance in a Post-Crisis World', University of Ancona, October 2010 Ron is Principal Investigator of a major ESRC project on Structural Transformation and City Economic Evolutions, part of the ESRC's Urban Transformations Initiative. (2015-2018) This strand of his research goes back originally to his PhD on wage and employment dynamics in urban labour markets in the United States, and has since broadened to encompass the theory of local labour markets, local unemployment problems, trade union decline, work in the 'new economy', issues of wage and income inequality, and the local impact of workfare schemes. Books published include: Over recent years, Ron has played a key role in the development of a new economic geography of money. His research under this theme covers global financial centres, the spatial structure of financial systems, venture capital markets, and the role of finance in regional economic development. Books include: Ron's research under this head covers a numbers of related issues. One is concerned with exploring the meaning, nature and significance of regional and urban competitive advantage. In what sense do regions and cities compete? What are the determinants of regional differences in competitive advantage? What are the implications for long-run regional development? A second theme has to do with the geographies of the so-called 'New Economy', and why this latest phase in capitalist development is emanating from some places rather than others, and how in turn it is reshaping the economic landscape. A third theme is concerned with the scope and limits of the concept of 'clusters' for understanding uneven regional development. Books include: Economic geography has always drawn, directly or indirectly, on economics as a source of theoretical inspiration. Ron's particular interest is in the application of heterodox forms of economics to economic geography, as well as responding to the recent emergence of the so-called 'new economic geography' within mainstream economics. More especially, his current focus is on the importation of concepts and ideas from evolutionary economics, and on exploring the scope for and nature of an evolutionary economic geography. Key articles include: Paul Krugman's Geographical Economics and Its Implications for Regional Development Theory: A Critical Assessment, (With P. Sunley), A common thread running through Ron's research is a strong commitment to the social and policy relevance of economic-geographic research, and firm belief that, wherever possible, academic geography should have public policy relevance. His own work on labour markets (especially on the New Deal), on regional competitiveness, and on regional venture capital markets, embodies this ethos. A current interest is in the spatialities of income inequality and poverty. He also researches how national state policies impact at the local and regional level, and the subnational implications of the ongoing neoliberalisation of state policies. Ron regularly provides research advice and consultancy to Government Departments (e.g. BEIS). He is an advisor to the European commission on its programme on Regional Economic Resilience. He has ben involved with numerous research project fr the European commission including the Impact of Globalisation on the European regions, the Determinants of Regional Economic Growth, The Competitiveness of European Regions, and the Rethinking Policy for Europe's Lagging Region. He has been involved in the preparation of evidence for the Core Cites Group and the Key Cities Group for submission to the Uk Government's Industrial Strategy Green Paper (2017). He also provides economic-geographic advice and consultancy to a number of private sector consultancies, including Local Futures (London), Cambridge Econometrics (Cambridge), Trends Business Research (Newcastle); Segal Quince Wicksteed, London.

Kiang's research interests include understanding the properties of cancer cells. Single cell force studies is used to probe the change in mecchanics and binding strength of cancer cells. The research focuses on understanding the interactions of biological molecules. Atomic force microscopy is used to study the forces between and within single biological molecules. The development of single-molecule techniques to studying molecular properties at the molecular level has expanded our understanding on the details of how biology and medicine function at the microscopic level. Kiang's group is studying proteins and DNA mechanics as well as developing new nanomanipulation techniques to study the properties of single-molecules. Cancer microenvironment plays a critical role in the last step of cancer metastasis \u2013 colonization. While the majority of early steps of cancer invasion-metastasis cascade are similar in different types of cancers, the colonization, including the attachment and growth of the secondary tumors, depends on the complex interactions between the metastasizing cells and the cancer microenvironment of the host tissues where they land. Currently, studies of cancer metastasis would provide valuable knowledge on how cancers spread. Cell adhesion force is a key parameter for cancer attachment and, therefore, may be used as the potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for cancer metastasis. This project utilizes single cell force measurement techniques to quantitatively study the effect of the substrate stiffness on cancer cell adhesion. Overall, this research may ultimately provide pertinent information on the key steps in cancer metastasis in a more physiological relevant context, thus improving upon current approaches in therapeutic development. The DNA-gold nanoparticle system is a model for phase transitions. Melting of short, free DNA is not a phase transition. However, when short DNA are bound to gold particles, the system undergoes a phase transition because the DNA-gold particles form networks of micrometer size, which is approaching a bulk phase. Thus, the binding transition in the network is much sharper than that of free DNA in solution, due to the cooperative melting process. Many fundamental aspects of phase transitions may be investigated with this biomolecular system. We use single-molecule technique to measure the force and to determine the free energy associated with single-stranded DNA unstacking and double-stranded DNA unzipping transition. The mechanics of dsDNA separation into ssDNA are key to the DNA replication and transcription processes. DNA is highly compacted in many instances. The mechanics and energetics of bending are applicable for fabrication of artificial DNA structures, as well as providing information about the forces that must be overcome by molecular machines and motors during the packaging process of DNA into a viral capsid. We wish to determine forces and free energies of DNA stretching and unzipping, which will allow us to quantify these transitions and to obtain a physical picture of these events. We are interested in the nucleic acid mechanical properties altered by DNA/RNA binding proteins. The change in stiffness of nucleic acids upon protein binding can be detected with single-molecule force spectroscopy. Protein binding to nucleic acids is important in many processes such as DNA repair, DNA/RNA replication, and genetic recombination. We are investigating the change in nucleic acid properties as it undergoes such transitions. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large glycoprotein in the blood that is responsible for blood clotting, or thrombosis, at the sites of vascular injury. To maintain hemostasis, VWF mediates platelet adhesion to the subendothelial connective tissue that lines the interior of all blood vessels and binds to the clotting factor VIII. As a glycoprotein, it can reach up to 100 micrometers in length and can exhibit tremendous flexibility in its structure. VWF function is activated by an allosteric mechanism or by high-shear induced force. Beyond the allosteric model, VWF are generally regulated by hydrodynamic forces within the blood vessels. In blood vessels, the shear rate of fluid is at its maximum near the subendothelial wall. Shear-induced adhesion enables VWF to bind to the endothelial under pathophysiological conditions and to initiate the blood clotting process at the site of vessel damage. We are studying VWF and ultra-large VWF resistance to mechanical forces and the effect of shear induced property changes. We will also study the VWF properties in the presence of ADAMTS-13 to test its reductase activity. Kiang uses atomic force microscopy to study the protein unfolding force of single biological molecules. The development of single-molecule techniques to study protein funciton at the molecular level has expanded our understanding on the details of how biology and medicine function at the macroscopic level. Her research focuses on the mechanical properties of titin, with an emphasis on applying Jarzynski's equality to determine the free energy of titin unfolding. E. W. Frey, J. Li, S. S.

This research served as a model for later studies of introduced mammals on other southern islands, and showed how differences in the nature and amounts of winter food had served to influence the population trajectories of introduced species. , Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge focused on the ecology and conservation of black rhinoceros in Luangwa Valley, Zambia. Threatened by illegal exploitation, little was known of the management or ecology of one of Africa's largest remaining populations of black rhinos and elephants. Although rhinos became locally extinct in Luangwa Valley, definitive strategies were formulated to manage rhinos and elephants under intense pressure from illegal exploitation, and the study provided the first scientific assessment of the effectiveness of conservation funding. As Chief Technical Advisor in Tanzania's Department of Wildlife, I established a planning unit to develop an information management system for the wildlife sector, and to create policies to enhance the conservation and economic potential of wildlife. Responsible to the Director of Wildlife, I initiated status assessments, organised appropriate consultative workshops, and completed national policies and management plans, including a review of the complex institutional structure of Tanzania's wildlife sector. Tanzania now moves slowly forward with implementing community-based conservation through locally managed wildlife management areas. At the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, my research group both investigated conflicts between conservation, people and other large mammals, and built research capacity in biodiversity-rich developing countries. Issues studied included: human-animal conflict, community-based conservation, common property resources, sustainable resource use, wildlife tourism, protected area management and planning, law enforcement and the implementation of international conventions. To address such issues, we studied a wide range of species including: African elephants and black rhinos, giraffes, mountain gorillas, bonobos, orangutans, West African manatees, saola, Przewalski's horses, tigers, lions, Ethiopian wolves, Andean bears, striped hyenas, Komodo dragons and Mexican reptiles, and undertook research in a wide range of countries including: Bolivia, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. for CITES Scientific Authorities on making non-detriment findings, the key step for successful implementation of the Convention (see Rosser and Heywood 2002). in Canterbury in July 2002, the first ever meeting of SCB to be held in Europe.

Head of Through my research I contribute to a better understanding of the driving mechanisms, spatial complexity and environmental impacts of climate variability, on historic and prehistoric timescales. My primary expertise lies in tephrochronology. I have worked widely across Europe and Africa using far-traveled volcanic ash (tephra) layers as isochrons to align archives and test the pacing of regional climatic and environmental transitions. In particular, I am interested in the role of changing climates and environments on hominin evolution and dispersal during the Late Pleistocene, and on historical societies in more recent times. By using tephra layers to directly connect archaeological archives to the palaeoenvironmental record, precise correlations between climatic changes and human histories can be made. Much of my current research focuses on building Late Quaternary tephrostratigraphies for volcanic regions of the East African Rift. Through the characterisation and correlation of visible and non-visible (crypto-) tephra layers in lake sediment archives, detailed stratified tephra records are contributing both to dating and correlation of important tropical palaeoclimate archives and to a better understanding of past volcanism and hazard in an understudied region. ; one of the leading bodies in palaeoclimate research. INTIMATE aims to reconstruct past abrupt and extreme climate changes over the last glacial cycle, through the precise INTegration of Ice-core, MArine, and TErrestrial records, on their own independent timescales. The combined data is used in climate models to better understand the mechanisms and impact of change, thereby reducing the uncertainty of future prediction. Research into the timing, cause and impacts of tropical megadrought events recorded in the sediments of East African Lake Challa, a 90 m deep crater lake on the flank of Kilimanjaro. Lake Challa contains an exceptional sedimentary record, with the proven potential to reconstruct past hydroclimate at high chronological precision and with dating accuracy not previously achieved in the tropics. The wider ICDP project on Lake Challa will study tropical hydroclimate and ecosystem development throughout the full ~250,000 year sediment record. Visible and non-visible tephra layers will be characterised and dated throughout the core, contributing to a high precision chronology and a first continuous tephrostratigraphic archive for the region. , Chew Bahir lies between the Ethiopian and Omo-Turkana Rifts and will provide a detailed record palaeoclimate for the Middle - Late Pleistocene. Far-travelled ashes preserved within the ~300 metre record will help us to date and correlate the palaeolake sediments. A collaborative research project between early career and experienced researchers from across Europe, that came out of the first EU COST funded INTIMATE Example training school in 2013. PI: S. Engels (Nottingham), C. Lane, D. Sachse (GFZ Potsdam). The sediments at Haemelsee record in detail the local to regional environmental responses to that palaeoclimate and palaeohydrological changes that occurred during the last Glacial to Interglacial Transition. Using a multi-proxy technique we aim to make precise regional comparisons of the timing and sequence of change at the onset and termination of the Younger Dryas Stadial.

These relatively weak forces are used in large number to create nanometer sized objects in a massively parallel fashion. The inspiration for this area of research comes primarily from advances in our understanding of biological systems and the miraculous structures found therein. Great strides have been made to mimic both the structures found in biological systems and the approaches that biology uses to create these structures. Although many of these advances are truly remarkable, and many may find practical application in the future, a situation has arisen where we are able to produce materials which have no easy method of manipulation or organization into higher order structures. It is analogous to being able to produce a wheel and an axle and having no way to connect them to one another, let alone to a cart. Alternatively one could compare this stage of supramolecular chemistry to traditional organic synthesis of a century ago when the number of chemical transformation and protecting groups were severely limited. In order to bring supramolecular chemistry to a new level of sophistication methods by which two or more supramolecular objects can be coupled or organized must be developed. My research is directed at solving this problem by employing a second step of self-assembly, covalent capture and / or mineralization to create complex and functional assemblies. Three projects are starting in my lab which address this. The first uses the self-assembly of ?coiled-coils? (a pair of alpha-helical peptides wound around one another) as a framework for the secondary self-assembly of a conductive organic matrix to form wires with nanometer dimensions. These wires, unlike most other approaches to nanoscale electronics, may be able to organize themselves in neural networks that can readily interface with traditional electronics. The second project is geared toward the synthesis of an artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) for use as a drug and cell delivery vehicle and tissue regeneration therapies. This biomimetic material will be prepared through two steps of self-assembly followed by covalent capture. The third project targets the synthesis of novel catalysts and magnetic materials. The preparation of these materials uses the mechanisms involved in biomineralization that allow biology to create an amazing diversity of inorganic and composite materials such as shells, teeth and bone. Research in my laboratory is focused on supramolecular chemistry - the interplay of groups of molecules through weak, non-covalent interactions such as electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, the hydrophobic effect and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Specifically we are interested in how these forces can be used to construct nanostructured organic materials through self-assembly. In the past century synthetic organic chemistry has developed into an extremely precise science in which nearly any molecule can be crafted with atomic precision. However, these traditional methods are limited to relatively small molecules with sizes generally below two nanometers. If one wants to produce molecules above this threshold there is no clear path to produce them because of the diminishing total yield on a long series of reactions. However, nature has shown us one method of producing such materials through the self-assembly of smaller, relatively easily prepared, subunits into large complex arrays. This type of synthesis can be seen in virtually every biological system including the assembly of lipids into the cell membrane, the assembly of proteins into viruses such as the beautiful cylindrical motif of the tobacco mosaic virus, the ubiquitous assembly of two complementary strands of DNA into a double helix, as well as the assembly of actin filaments, collagen fibers and microtubules. The synthesis of molecules and materials in this difficult size regime, from two nanometers to hundreds of nanometers, promises to have an enormous impact on drug delivery, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and cancer therapy as this is the size scale of the cellular machinery. Being able to intimately understand and interact with these structures will likely require making ones of similar scale. At the same time materials of this size scale, which are far smaller that those that are able to be produced by standard lithographic methods, are highly desirable for the miniaturization of machines and electronics in the growing area of nanotechnology. To address these challenges and opportunities my laboratory is focused on preparing a variety of nanostructured organic materials using self-assembly. The projects can be divided into three groups, although there is overlap between each of the three areas. The first project utilizes the well known coiled-coil motif, which is found in a large number of natural proteins, to control the self-assembly of a number of important nanostructured materials. We would like to be able to self-assemble short alpha-helices into much longer coiled-coils and yet maintain control over the length of this supramolecular polymerization. Although many groups have been working with one-dimensional self-assembled materials an important objective of controlling the length of these materials has not yet been achieved and we feel that our system will be able to solve this problem by using a molecular vernier approach. Also, utilizing coiled-coil systems we are attempting to mimic a variety of important fibrous proteins such as the intermediate filaments (laminin, karatin, etc.) and myosin II. The second project is to prepare mimics of extracellular matrix proteins and to use these synthetic materials as novel biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and regeneration. The first molecules we have targeted for synthesis are collagen and elastin. They will be prepared by a combination of self-assembly and covalent capture. Both molecules are critical for the structural organization and mechanical properties of tissues and we believe that synthetic versions of these materials will be extremely valuable to the advancement of tissue engineering. Finally, the third project utilizes nanostructured organic scaffolds prepared by self-assembly (for example the collagen fibers described above) as a template for biomimetic mineralization to prepare composite organic-inorganic materials for applications ranging from hard tissue (bone and teeth) engineering to novel catalysts, and optical, electronic and magnetic materials.

Over the past decade Alex has sought to examine the nature and consequences of international intervention after conflict, particularly focusing on the former Yugoslavia. This work has been roughly divided into three areas of inquiry: Geographies of state formation. This research has explored the role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in fostering democratic participation after violent conflict. Over several periods of residential fieldwork in Bosnia and Herzegovina Alex has sought to investigate how donors, new state institutions and intervening agencies shape the agendas of NGOs. This work has been funded by an ESRC Studentship (R42200134266), an ESRC Postdoctoral Fellowship (PTA-026-27-0576) and internal funding from Newcastle University. Key outputs include papers in Legal Geopolitics. Focusing specifically on the experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this strand of research has explored the process of establishing a domestic War Crimes Chamber with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes undertaken during the 1992-5 war.

Mike Hulme joined the Department at Cambridge in September 2017, following a period of four years as professor of climate and culture in the Department of Geography at King's College London where he was Head of Department. From 2000 to 2007 he was the Founding Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, a multi-institutional and inter-disciplinary research centre based at the University of East Anglia (UEA). For 12 years prior to establishing the Tyndall Centre, Hulme worked in the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at UEA and had the dubious honour of having five years' worth of his professional email correspondence released to public scrutiny as a result of the Climategate controversy. While in CRU, Hulme specialised in the compilation and analysis of global climate datasets and the construction and application of climate change scenarios for impact, adaptation and integrated assessment. He led the preparation of a series of climate scenarios and reports for the UK Government and in 2007 he received a personalised certificate from the Nobel Peace Prize committee in recognition of his 'significant contribution' to the work of the United Nations' IPCC. Hulme continues as the founding Editor-in-Chief of the review journal Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews (WIREs) Climate Change, with a journal impact factor of 4.6. Hulme studies the numerous ways in which the idea of climate-change is constructed and deployed in public, political and scientific discourse, exploring both its historical, cultural and scientific origins and its contemporary meanings. His work has appeared in academic journals in the sciences, social sciences and humanities and has profoundly shaped the way in which the idea of climate-change is being studied, communicated and mobilised, in both the academy and public life. He draws inspiration from the geography of science, STS, environmental history and political ecology, but his research can be understood as defining a new field of critical climate anthropology. Hulme's most recent book is Weathered: A Cultural Geography of Climate (SAGE, 2017), which explores how different cultures around the world make sense of their weather and climate. Among his other books are Can Science Fix Climate Change? A Case Against Climate Engineering (Polity Press, 2014) and Why We Disagree About Climate Change (CUP, 2009). This latter has was chosen by The Economist magazine as one of its science and technology books of the year and has become one of the standard university texts worldwide for social science and humanities students studying climate change. It was selected by CUP in November 2015 as one of their top 20 most influential books of all time, 'influencing policy-making, contributing to social change and altering intellectual landscapes'.

Our research group seeks to fill in these gaps by: 1) designing and implementing novel approaches to engineer biological systems; and 2) elucidating the metabolic and regulatory networks that control the functioning of biological systems. Our ultimate goal is to effectively engineer biology and enable applications in energy and chemical production, environmental remediation, pharmaceutical production, and agricultural systems. Our research program is organized into two general areas: 1) Metabolic Engineering and Synthetic Biology; and 2) Microbial and Cellular Metabolism. Our laboratory has successfully: - engineered a functional reversal of the b-oxidation cycle as an efficient platform for the synthesis of higher-chain (C \u2265 4) fuels and chemicals; - established a new metabolic engineering platform for the production of fuels and chemicals using glycerol as the carbon source; and other bacteria can anaerobically ferment glycerol, a previously unknown metabolic capability of this organism, establishing a new paradigm for the fermentative metabolism of glycerol in bacteria; and - developed and used systems biology tools to achieve an improved understanding of carbon and energy metabolism in bacterial and mammalian cell cultures Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology are emerging disciplines that enable the design and engineering of biological systems for a wide range of applications. In this area, we have pioneered the engineering of glycerol fermentation and metabolism of waste fatty acids for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals and the development of a functional reversal of the b-oxidation cycle as an efficient platform for the synthesis of longer-chain (C \u2265 4) products. below) has laid the foundation to establish glycerol fermentation as a new metabolic engineering platform for fuel and chemical production. We pioneered the engineering of bacteria to efficiently convert glycerol to fuels and chemicals such as succinate, ethanol, hydrogen, formate, and D-lactate. We have also established a novel platform for the production of fuels and chemicals from fatty acid-rich feedstocks by engineering a respiro-fermentative metabolic mode that enables the efficient production of target products in combination with adequate catabolism of FAs. For the first time, we engineered efficient synthesis of ethanol, butanol, acetate, acetone, isopropanol, succinate, and propionate from fatty acids in bacteria. Advanced, higher-chain (C \u2265 4) fuels and chemicals are generated from short-chain, 2- or 3-C metabolic intermediates through pathways that require carbon-chain elongation. While we have engineered native carbon-chain elongation pathways, such as the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, to produce higher-chain molecules like methylketones, this pathway suffers from major energy constraints. Motivated in part by these limitations, we recently engineered a functional reversal of the \u03b2-oxidation cycle that can be used as a general platform for the synthesis of short-, medium- and long-chain products with structural and functional diversity. Through a systems-level, quantitative assessment of the metabolic capabilities of the engineered reversal of the \u03b2-oxidation cycle, we demonstrated that product synthesis can be coupled to cell growth and achieved at high fluxes, titers and yields. The superior capabilities of the \u03b2-oxidation reversal, when compared to other pathways used for carbon-chain elongation, originate from its higher energetic efficiency, which is enabled by the use of acetyl-CoA as an extender unit. This engineered b-oxidation reversal is currently being exploited in our laboratory for the production of alcohols, alkanes, and omega-functionalized products. Our laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. Wong and Dr. Halas, has recently explored the engineering of light-triggered bionanoparticles (LTBNP) for cellular reprogramming. In this concept, a laser is used as a discrete signal that leads to localized photothermal heating of LTBNPs, which in turn control protein and cellular functioning. Our first publication in this area demonstrated the Metabolism is a complex system that encompasses all biochemical reactions and processes that occur in living organisms along with their interaction and regulation. Our incomplete knowledge of metabolism greatly limits our ability to engineer biological systems. To address this issue, our laboratory engages in fundamental studies that contribute to the creation of the knowledge base require to the effective engineering of metabolism. and other bacteria. The knowledge base created by these studies enabled the engineering of bacteria for the synthesis of a wide arrange of products, as described under \u201c We have demonstrated that using a system-level approach provides an unprecedented understanding of microbial metabolism otherwise not achievable through classical biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. For example, using metabolic flux analysis we discovered the role of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex on the fermentative metabolism of glucuronate and glucose in remained unknown and this enzyme was thought unable to support fermentative growth. In this area we have also developed new methods and tools that facilitate the system-level analysis of microbial and cellular metabolism. We have also used system-level methods and tools to elucidate key aspects of microbial and cellular metabolism. For example, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the fermentative metabolism of glycerol in through the use of kinetic modeling and Metabolic Control Analysis and elucidated the control structure of the pathways involved in glycerol utilization and ethanol synthesis. These findings were then used to identify key targets for genetic manipulation that enhanced product synthesis. Similar approaches enabled an improved understanding of apoptosis in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell cultures during the production of recombinant proteins and the anaerobic metabolism of E. coli during glucose fermentation. We have also continued fundamental studies to establish the mechanisms and pathways enabling glycerol fermentation in bacteria. Gonzalez, R. Murarka. A., Dharmadi, Y., and Yazdani, S. S. (2008).

I am particularly interested in the dynamics of gene regulation - from small-scale interactions such as transcription and translation, to the large-scale dynamics of gene regulatory networks. I use a hybrid experimental and computational approach to uncover the underlying design principles governing native gene networks and to use these concepts to design novel synthetic circuits. The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is the creation of practical, engineered genetic circuits for medical and industrial applications. Critical to this goal is the elucidation of the fundamental mechanisms that govern gene regulation at all levels. To this end, my work has focused on the kinetic properties of both synthetic networks, such as gene oscillators, and native regulatory networks, such as the galactose utilization pathway in Currently, my lab uses both bacteria and yeast as model organisms to study genetic signaling networks, which are central to cellular decision-making processes. By detecting and interpreting dynamic cues, these networks enable cells to adapt to their surroundings in a context-dependent manner. We want to know: 1) how information is relayed from one genetic module to the next; 2) how network architecture determines the fidelity of the signal; and 3) how problems arising from network deficiencies or deleterious mutations might be alleviated. The work in my lab is highly interdisciplinary, combining aspects of synthetic biology, microfluidic engineering, and theoretical physics. Synthetic biology is used to create novel gene circuits as well as perturb naturally occurring gene networks. These networks are then examined at the single-cell level with the aid of microfluidic devices that allow for the precise control over environmental conditions. Finally, mathematical models are used to understand the observed phenomenon and aid in the design of future synthetic gene networks.

I am interested in how labour markets are shaped, structured and regulated -- and what the implications of this are for contemporary work. My research lies at the intersection of political economy and economic and labour geographies. Much of my research examines the urban politics and labour market dynamics of union organising in place. Other labour research explores processes of labour market change, geographies of organised labour, immigrant workers, aging and youth at work, underemployment, precarious work, and social networks in the workplace. I am interested in how categories of social difference like gender, race, age, and class relate to how labour is rewarded, valued and regulated in and across place. . This research examines the intertwining of the economic, social and political effects on the local decisions around austerity and the shaping of the local state. This project highlights the uneven nature of the budget cuts, the political coalitions surrounding funding change, and the institutional mechanisms which promote change in policy priorities in the UK, the US, and Canada. , which explores the themes of austerity, precarious work, the ethics of care, and debt. The intentionally provocative play encourages audiences to explore solutions to the problems highlighted in the play. Audiences can debate the action, advise the characters, or even get up on stage and change the scene. Read more about The work on austerity is related to my long-standing interest in regional economies. In past research, I explore the regional and workplace implications of changing working patterns, identity and cultural norms; implications of austerity; and links between globalisation and regional economies. Finally, I have been exploring the geographic implications of alternative finance, such as crowd-funding and venture philanthropy, and its effects on regional economies, labour markets, and the distribution of opportunity. which publishes multi-disciplinary international research on the spatial dimensions of contemporary socio-economic-political change. The Journal adopts a focused thematic format. Each issue is devoted to a particular theme selected by the international editorial team. The aim of the Journal is to understand the formative changes and developments associated with the new spatial foundations of today's globalizing world and examines how changes in the global economy are playing out across different spatial scales. My current research explores the contours of the current rounds of austerity. This projects looks at the coalitions formed around austerity cuts and the many \"hidden\" aspects of austerity. I have been examining alternative forms of financing of business, the public sector and community projects, through work on crowd-funding and venture philanthropy. I have also been examining the geographies of union growth in the low-paid service sector for over a decade.

Urban nature encompasses a disparate body of work and ideas ranging from scientific analysis of ecological assemblages to the cultural valorization of \"cosmopolitan natures\". I am interested in exploring changing meanings of urban nature through interdisciplinary and historical analysis of emerging cultures of nature under modernity. By linking urban ecology with post-humanist insights there are clear points of interconnection with network-oriented ontologies of human subjectivity and extended conceptions of agency. I am building on my previous work on cyborg urbanization to examine corporeal dimensions to urban space including geographies of sound, light, and sexuality. There is significant scope for a critically reworked political ecology, in combination with new insights into the independent agency of nature, to explore evolving relationships between human health and the urban environment. Although existing studies within environmental history and other fields have emphasized the role of infrastructure networks and other measures against the threat of water-borne disease these insights can be extended to other socio-ecological dimensions of urban space. I have long been fascinated by \"wastelands\" since my early forays into London's so-called \"bomb sites\". A focus on spontaneous forms of urban nature transcends the merely speculative or utilitarian potentialities of ostensibly empty spaces. Within urban ecology significant attention has been devoted to wastelands as \"ecological refugia\" or \"islands\" of bio-diversity. These spontaneous ecologies serve as \"accidental laboratories\" for cultural and scientific curiosity. Ecological rhetoric is often widely deployed as a pretext for the elimination of pre-existing spaces of nature that already have high levels of cultural and scientific interest. But what kind of landscape aesthetics is invoked by the protection of spontaneous spaces of urban nature? How can cultural or scientific complexity become part of a vibrant public culture? My recent research on Gilles Cl\u00e9ment, for example, suggests that a different kind of synthesis between ecological science and urban design might be possible. The ambiguity of urban nature and the limits to scientific knowledge have been a focus for a variety of cultural interventions since the early 1970s. In these instances close observation, or the \"botanical eye\", becomes a specific form of cultural-scientific practice that can reveal new insights into the production of space and the often arbitrary assignment of cultural and economic value. The multiplicity of cultural responses to urban nature, ranging from literature to cinema, is partly related to the diversity of such sites and their varied origins: whilst some spaces have developed spontaneously within ostensibly \"empty\" sites, others have emerged from neglect or abandonment.

Research Associate in the Michael Bravo has an interdisciplinary background with a humanities Ph.D. (Cantab 1992) in the history and philosophy of science, building on a technical background with a B.Eng. (Carleton 1985) in satellite communications engineering. Bravo has written extensively on the role of scientific research in the exploration and development of the Arctic, exploring issues in historical epistemology including the philosophy of experiment, measurement in fieldwork, the nature of precision and calibration, science and technology in translation, and the historical emergence of new ontologies. The Pan-Inuit Trails Atlas is my most recent project. With a major grant from the Social Sciences Research Council of Canada, and in collaboration with Claudio Aporta and Fraser Taylor (Carleton University), I visited Pond Inlet situated near the entrance to Lancaster Sound at the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage to begin to document the community's use of these waters. This field work complemented the team's development of the . The principal sources for the Inuit knowledge that defines this Atlas, are maps that were drawn by Inuit for visiting scientists, missionaries, and traders over the course of centuries. Brought together and mapped with their geo-spatial data, the Atlas for the first time presents an indigenous cartographic vision of Arctic North America, showing the network of trails that Inuit peoples travelled and used to communicate over great distances from Alaska to Greenland. The Atlas can be viewed online at http://paninuittrails.org. (2002), I explore the implications of the Arctic's extraordinary historical diversity through the lens of the Scandinavian Arctic. The point of this book is to reveal how the Arctic as one of the world's major geographical regions comprises fundamentally different historical processes of colonisation and integration. The field sciences have for centuries played important roles in defining how the Arctic is understood and governed in ways that continue to shape the region as we know it today. was the result of a collaboration with Nicola Triscott of Arts Catalyst (London) and the Slovenian artist Marko Peljhan. As the dominant discourses of Arctic geopolitics are blind to the realities of life in the Arctic, its peoples and ecosystems are repeatedly trivialized in both geopolitics and the arts. This book explores how technologies have transformed relationships between environment and politics for Inuit and other northern peoples. The key question seen from five distinct vantage points is to what extent we should look to experiments in technology to bring autonomy to the citizens of the Arctic. Is a strategy to develop new green technologies for Arctic societies coherent and likely to succeed as a means to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons? The authors argue that the liberating potential of technologies to build lasting autonomy depends on the kinds of mobility and transformations of political economy that they make possible. Together the essays reveal a new approach to the study of technology and mobility that may allow us to rethink Arctic geopolitics from the ground up. Michael Bravo is Head of the Circumpolar History and Public Policy Research Group at the Scott Polar Research Institute, as well being a member of the Geography Department's Bravo is Co-Director with Claudio Aporta (Dalhousie) of the Inuit Northwest Passage Project. Thanks to a major research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the project team has launched the Pan-Inuit Trails Atlas. Akin to the \"songlines\" of Aboriginal Australians, the continent of North America has long been known to the indigenous Inuit through a remarkable and extensive network of trails that has remained largely hidden to the rest of the world. Inuit traditional travel changed seasonally with the climate, so that the network of trails spanning the continent was most navigable across the winter sea ice, as well as the snow-covered coastal and inland routes. Inuit have long been famous for their journeys, but the precise extent of them has rarely been fully appreciated. This project represents a first attempt to map these trails along with their geo-spatial data to show how they connected the thousands of different camps and other sites known to Inuit. The atlas can only give a partial indication, a sense of just some of the most important routes travelled, amongst the many. Taken together, they reveal an extraordinary command of territory that long preceded the arrival of explorers looking for a Northwest Passage. Yet this network of trails proved to be highly resilient in the face of encounters with European and American scientific and commercial interests, adapting to them. The Atlas can be viewed online at http://paninuittrails.org. Whereas the importance of the world oceans for global security - particularly their circulation, oil and gas reserves, fishing stocks and indigenous culture - is now widely recognised, they are all threatened or endangered. However our knowledge of their environmental history, how they came to be the way they are, is surprisingly limited and at best fragmented. Dr. Bravo's research aims to develop the historical foundations for a new interdisciplinary understanding of the science of the oceans that can explain the nature and direction of change, and take account of the much greater and more diverse communities of historical actors or stakeholders than has been widely acknowledged. 'Science' is often made to function as a vehicle of public policy. In G8 nations science and technology have a long history of involvement in economic planning. This is certainly true in the Arctic, my region of special interest, where science has played a variety of roles in colonisation, nation-building, and environmental monitoring The use of field sciences as policy instruments remains poorly understood, for all that climate change has brought them into the public eye. I am currently working on developing new models that explain the linkages between the field sciences and public policy. To explore the practical application of models, I have also been asked to act as an advisor for the International Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARP) The project has a strong historical foundation in order to ascertain why field stations only came into existence relatively recently (mid- to late-C19), what they are intended to accomplish, and how they have served to mediate between scientists, the state, and the inhabitants of the field.

This paper will be the opening publication in an international collaborative project for International Polar Year (2007-2008) about the history of field stations. This paper argues that the scientific accomplishments of William Scoresby Jr., Britain's most famous Arctic whaler, can be best understood in a wider historical context of social, economic, and technological 'improvement'. Seen in this light, we can understand how Scoresby's industrial-scale access to the Arctic Seas enabled his rapid rise through the patronage of Robert Jameson into the world of scientific savants like Alexander von Humboldt and Leopold von Buch. 1998 Bravo, M.

A second research theme is the study of the active sites, mechanism of catalysis and of allosteric regulation of enzymes of nucleotide biosynthesis. A current focal point is the regulation of transcription of the ten-cistron pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) operon in Bacillus subtilis, which we have shown to be governed by the protein, called PyrR, encoded by the first gene of the operon. This protein, which also catalyzes uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity, promotes transcriptional termination at three attenuation sites in the pyr operon. PyrR acts by binding in a uridine nucleotide dependent manner to specific sites on pyr mRNA and altering its conformation, so that a transcription terminator is formed. The PyrR protein has been purified to homogeneity and its 3D structure has been determined. Our current objectives are to characterize the PyrR protein, the RNA to which it binds, and the PyrR-RNA interaction at high resolution. The regulatory activities of PyrR are being examined by physical, biochemical and genetic methods. We are examining regulation of pyr genes by PyrR in other bacteria, including clinically important pathogens. Our laboratory also studies the regulation by transcriptional antitermination of the B. subtilis pyrG gene, which encodes CTP synthase. This gene is regulated independently of the pyr operon by a highly novel mechanism, which involves reiterative transcription or \"transcriptional slippage\" and no regulatory protein. We are extending our understanding of this mechanism by genetic and biochemical approaches. J\u00f8rgensen. C. M., Fields, C. J., Chander, P., Watt, D., Burgner, J. W., II, Smith, J.

However, they have developed a sophisticated locomotion to escape harm and find favorable conditions. This is the process of chemotaxis. It arose billions of years ago, long before eukaryotes existed, and handles signaling tasks common to all cell sensory systems: detecting stimuli, processing and integrating inputs, and producing appropriate responses. Ease of genetic manipulation and cloning and rapid growth have proven important advantages for studying sensory processes in prokaryotes and general insights into cellular signaling mechanisms are emerging. Bacteria pioneered the use of reversible protein phosphorylation to send an excitatory signal to alter motile behavior and the use of reversible receptor methylesterification to terminate the signal in the process of adaptation. The signal controls movement of the flagella. In our laboratory, we are studying how these receptors control protein phosphorylation and phosphoryl transfer in the gram positive bacterium . They have been cloned and sequenced. Several proteins, in addition to the receptors, are also involved in this signal transduction process. We have cloned and manipulated the corresponding genes and are studying the interactions of the proteins. In addition there appear to be three adaptational systems at work to help extinguish the excitatory signal so that the bacteria are again poised to receive new information -- one involving the methyltransferase and methylesterase, another involving the novel proteins CheC and CheD in a feedback system with the response regulator CheY-P, and a third involving phosphorylation of CheV. This is a process that appears to be shared with the archaea, although not with , where simple addition or hydrolysis of methyl groups on the receptors suffices for adaptation. Thus, it may be the means by which the primordial bacteria carried out chemotaxis. We are especially interested in characterizing three proteins -- CheC, CheD, and CheV -- which have no counterparts in , for they play important roles in this novel process. In general, having many of the genes cloned and selectively mutagenizing them has allowed us to get important insights into how the corresponding proteins are functioning. Yuan, W., G.D.

Either a Schwann cell in the peripheral nervous system or an oligodendrocyte in the central nervous system is capable of forming myelin. There is extensive signaling and cross talk between the myelin-forming cell and the neuron to control the various stages of myelin formation, i.e., cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Of particular interest are the growth factors and hormones that regulate these stages. Steroid hormones, such as progesterone, have been shown to play a role in the regulation of myelin synthesis. The mRNAs for the enzymes that make progesterone are induced at the onset of myelin synthesis. Changes in gene expression caused by steroid hormones are being examined to identify additional signal transduction molecules that control myelin formation. One major theme of our research concerns a new model of membrane structure involving the existence of lipid and protein domains. It is proposed that many components of signal transduction pathways are organized into functional domains. When a growth factor or hormone stimulates a cell, it first binds to a receptor in the plasma membrane and this triggers a cascade of events that depends on the type of cell. If the components are organized into a domain this would greatly increase the specificity and efficiency of the process. This has been most closely studied with the membrane factors that activate protein kinase C and result in the phosphorylation of target proteins. The activators, substrates, and the enzyme can be organized into domains that produce faster rates of reaction. This also provides a novel level of regulation for the signal transduction process.

We are primarily interested in the structure and function of membrane proteins that are proton pumps. Our efforts are directed at several membrane enzymes that are components of bacterial respiratory or photosynthetic electron transport systems. Of principle interest are the members of the large respiratory oxidase superfamily known as the heme-copper oxidases. This superfamily includes the mammalian cytochrome c oxidase and many prokaryotic homologues. The structures of two enzymes in this superfamily have been determined to atomic resolution by X-ray diffraction techniques. The heme-copper oxidases caltalyze the reduction of O2 and utilize the free energy liberated by this reaction to pump protons electrogenically across the membrane bilayer (4 H+/O2). This generates transmembrane voltage and pH gradients, constituting the protonmotive force. The protonmotive force is used to drive ATP synthesis, active transport of solutes and other reactions. The structure of these enyzmes show two putative proton-conducting channels and we are interested in the roles of residues in these channels during the catalytic cycle. The bacterial oxidases offer the opportunity to utilize the full array of molecular genetics techniques in combination with spectroscopic methods to address the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. Single-turnover rapid kinetics techniques are being utilized to examine these questions using site-directed mutations in representative members of each of the three major families comprising the heme-copper oxidase superfamily. These include enzymes from E. coli, R. sphaeroides, T. thermophilus and V. cholerae. In addition, we are utilizing FTIR difference spectroscopy to identify specific amino acids directly engaged in the catalytic mechanism. One set of mutants of particular interest are those which decouple oxidase activity from proton pumping. We are investigating these mutants as a new important tool to explore the mechanism of the proton pump. In addition to the studies on the heme-copper oxidases, we are also examining other respiratory enzymes that generate a protonmotive force, including the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase from E. coli. We are using techniques aimed at obtaining structural information, including X-ray diffraction, as well as examining aspects of the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes. Chang, H. Y., Choi, S.

The complex is central to all major energy conversion pathways. It oxidizes ubiquinol, reduces cytochrome c, and uses the work potential to form the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. We study the enzyme from the photosynthetic bacterium by photoactivation of the photosynthetic reaction center, which generates the substrates for the complex. With crystallographic structures now available, we take advantage of spectroscopic techniques and protocols for protein engineering that allow us to modify the three catalytic subunits, and ask specific questions about the structure using kinetic spectrophotometry, and rapid-mix freeze-quench approaches and EPR spectroscopy to trap and measure reaction intermediates, to probe function and topology of the complex, and the detailed mechanism of partial processes. Our studies have revealed novel mechanisms of electron transfer in the complex; one involves a dramatic domain movement of the extrinsic domain of the iron sulfur protein; more tentative is another proposal for movement of a semiquinone intermediate at the catalytic site. Detailed spectroscopic studies (ESEEM, ENDOR) allow us to probe structure local to paramagnetic catalytic intermediates that are not accessible through crystallography. Our current work involves the role of semiquinone intermediates, the pathway for H release from catalytic sites through water chains, and electron transfer across the dimer interface that complicates the simple monomeric Q-cycle mechanism. We are studying these using a variety of biophysical, biochemical, computational and molecular engineering approaches. The project also involve several local and international collaborative projects. A more esoteric interest comes from attempts to quantify global fluxes in the biosphere. This introduces questions about information fluxes, the role of semantic content and its thermodynamic status, leading to deeper philosophical interests. 2.

Serreze is the Director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). While his research has encompassed all aspects of our planet's cryosphere - ie snow and ice cover - he has a long standing love of the Arctic. Interests include atmosphere-sea ice interactions, synoptic climatology, boundary layer problems, and climate change. He has conducted field work in the Canadian Arctic on sea ice and icecaps, and on the Alaskan tundra. Efforts over the past ten years have increasingly focused on trying to make sense of the rapid environmental changes being observed in the Arctic. Arctic sea ice reflects sunlight, keeping the Arctic cool and moderating global climate. Arctic sea ice has declined dramatically over at least the past thirty years, most strongly in late summer. The extreme seasonal ice extent minima of September 2007 and 2008 serve as exclamation points on the downward trend, fueling concern that rapid transition to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean may be underway. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) ( ) provides year-round analysis of Arctic sea ice conditions. Rapid processing of satellite data yields near real-time (one day lag) updates of Arctic sea ice extent. During the first week of each month, and more frequently during the summer melt season, NSIDC scientists provide scientific analysis of evolving sea ice conditions and comparisons with previous years. I can trace my interest in snow, ice and very cold water to growing up in Maine, where in most winters there is plenty of all three. Many a childhood afternoon was spent daredevil sledding, skating, or foolishly riding ice floes down the Kennebunk River on the outgoing tide. I come from a science family. Grandpa was involved in the early development of radar. Both of my parents became research chemists. My brother is involved in immunology research and my uncle works with lasers and solar cells. Perhaps there is some genetic aberration at work.

Once the central protein C3 is activated to C3b, this activates more C3. Regulation of C3b by molecules such as Factor H is essential for an appropriate complement response. We have looked at many of the complement proteins, such as Factor H, C3 and CR2. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes loss of central vision and accounts for 50% of blind registration in the Western World, mostly in the over-50 age group. A key feature of AMD is the presence of drusen that are extra-cellular deposits between Bruch's membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium. The accumulation of drusen-associated molecules suggests a complement attack. A single point mutation in Factor H at Tyr402His is associated with many AMD cases. This is proximate to binding sites for several ligands such as heparin and C-reactive protein. Other ligand-binding regions of Factor H are associated with kidney failure, most notably atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Scattering and ultracentrifugation methods are powerful tools for understanding the role of Factor H, and we have performed many studies with Factor H. See http://www.fh-hus.org I obtained my BA in Chemistry and my DPhil in Molecular Biophysics from Oxford University. I obtained EMBO and EMBL Fellowships to work at the ETH-Zurich and at EMBL-Grenoble. I was awarded a Lister Fellowship held at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, Hammersmith, London. I was then appointed to a Wellcome Trust Lecturership at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, and obtained my Personal Chair in 1998 at the same same as this merged with UCL. I moved to the main campus of UCL in 2002. I have published over 200 papers, mostly in the field of structural immunology applied to the five human antibody classes and to the complement proteins of innate immunity.

When I was at ETH Zurich as assistant professor in the group of Prof. Michele Parrinello (2006-2009), I crucially contributed to the development of 3 widely used methods to overcome the time-scale problem and compute free energy surfaces, namely Metadynamics, Parallel-Tempering Metadynamics and the path-like collective variables method (PCV). These methods are able to efficiently compute the free energy landscape associated with complex events, such as folding, lingand-target association and large-scale conformational changes. As the leader of the Computational Biophysics group at CNIO and more recently Professor at UCL, I continued the development of computational methods, including a very efficient method to compute the kinetics associated with complex biological events (TS-PPTIS), and applied these methods to better understand the mode of action of anticancer drugs. A recent highlight of our research was the clarification of the complex mode of action of the first allosteric inhibitor (SSR) of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor. The free energy simulations have shown that SSR induces a previously unknown conformational change in the extracellular portion of FGFR. The accurate structural information obtained from the simulations has been used to design SSR derivatives now in pre-clinical development as anti-cancer agents.

Please contact Kai Zhang (kaizkaiz@illinois.edu) with a description of your scientific research interests. The Zhang group studies how signal transduction regulates cell fate determination and how normal signaling processes are compromised in disease conditions. Using live cell imaging and optogenetic control of signal transduction, we observe and perturb signaling modules to define cellular responses. Our major goal is to gain insight into signaling mechanisms that regulate critical cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis and to apply the insight to understanding and treating neurological disorders. Cells are constantly making decisions in response to their environments. Intracellular signal transduction transmits external stimuli into the cell interior and regulates transcription and translation. Growth factor-mediated signal transduction regulates a wide spectrum of cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. Dysregulated growth factor signaling has been observed in various diseases including cancers or neurological disorders. Intriguingly, different growth factors trigger distinct cellular functions via activation of similar downstream signaling cascades such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, and phospholipase C (PLC). Consequently, a central question in growth-factor mediated signal transduction is how the same set of signaling cascades elicits such diverse yet specific cellular outcomes. Previous research has suggested that cells employ spatiotemporal regulation of their signaling cascades to convey specificity of cell fate determination. For instance, epidermal growth factor (EGF) triggers a transient MAPK activation and induces cell proliferation; nerve growth factor (NGF) triggers a sustained MAPK activation and induces cell differentiation. Directed cell migration is driven by asymmetric subcellular activation of actin dynamics. Conventional pharmacological and genetic approaches have continuously expanding our knowledge base of signaling components involved in signaling networks. These approaches, however, lack the resolution of spatial and temporal control. A better understanding of signaling mechanisms therefore calls for new tools that can precisely control intracellular signaling in both space and time. Optogenetics combines the power of light and genetics and enables precise spatial and temporal control of individual signaling cascades. Our previous work used light to control the MAPK signaling pathway and quantitatively revealed the kinetic effect of the MAPK signaling on cell differentiation. In the long term, we aim to 1) extend optogenetic modules for activating other growth factor signaling pathways, 2) dissect how spatiotemporal regulation of growth-factor signal pathways determine cell fate, and 3) develop new optogenetic tools using protein engineering, computation, and genetic screening. Neurons are the most polarized cell types, extending processes 10,000 times the size of their cell bodies. In such a polarized cell, Brownian diffusion is not sufficient to drive efficient communications across the whole neuron cell. For a small molecule to diffuse from the hand to the brain, it will take about 30 years! Instead, communication between different parts of neuronal cells requires active transport. Cargoes containing signaling molecules or newly synthesized proteins are transported along the cytoskeletal tracks of axons, very similar to the vehicle transport on highways. Defective axonal transport has been observed in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, to name a few. The Zhang group studies the neurotrophic signaling pathway that primarily regulates neuronal differentiation and survival. Our previous work has shown that axonal transport can be either slowed down or accelerated in neurological disorders. We use compartmentalized microfluidic devices to spatially segregate and control the chemical environment of axons and cell bodies. We use live cell imaging to track the axonal transport of fluorescently labeled cargos. Our long term goal is to determine how axonal transport is affected by specific neuronal phenotypes and how manipulation of axonal transport may rescue these phenotypes.

Research in the laboratory continues to investigate novel and conventional clathrin functions that are important for human health. Clathrin-coated vesicles control protein traffic from the plasma membrane and through intracellular compartments, influencing cell-cell interactions and affecting diverse physiological processes. Recent studies from the lab reveal a wider range of clathrin functions including actin organisation during infection and cell migration, a specific role for a novel clathrin isoform in glucose metabolism related to Type 2 Diabetes, and roles in oncogenesis through microtubule interactions. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis for clathrin-mediated membrane traffic and its regulation. Clathrin proteins have a triskelion (three-legged) shape and self-assemble into lattices. Each triskelion comprises three clathrin heavy chain subunits, which mediate self-assembly and coat formation. The canonical clathrin heavy chain subunit, CHC17, binds three light chain subunits. However, the functions of the clathrin light chain subunits, and particularly their diversity, are not fully defined. In vertebrates, genes CLTA and CLTB encode clathrin light chains CLCa and CLCb, which are 40% divergent in sequence. One major research programme in our group aims to understand how vertebrate light chain diversity contributes to tissue specificity of clathrin-mediated membrane traffic. In humans and other vertebrates there is a second isoform of clathrin heavy chain, CHC22. Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that in human muscle and fat cells, CHC22 plays an important role in the insulin-regulated trafficking of the GLUT4 glucose transporter. In response to insulin, GLUT4 is inserted into the plasma membrane, where it transports glucose from the blood into the cell. Disrupted GLUT4 trafficking may underlie the insulin resistance that precedes Type 2 Diabetes. Current studies suggest that CHC22 is involved in controlling GLUT4 retention and insulin-stimulated release. Our second major research programme aims to explore this hypothesis, and to elucidate the biochemical, cellular, and physiological roles of CHC22 clathrin. The Brodsky Laboratory has been studying clathrin biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology for nearly 30 years. The group was based at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) until 2014, when Professor Brodsky accepted a position as Professor of Cell Biology and Director of the Division of Biosciences at University College London (UCL). Frances Brodsky graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Biochemical Sciences in 1976, and earned her doctorate from Oxford University under a Marshall Scholarship in 1979. Brodsky's graduate work with immunologist Sir Walter Bodmer applied the then-novel technology of monocolonal antibodies to study human histocompatability molecules (HLA). Brodsky worked as a postdoctoral fellow, first with Jack Strominger at Harvard, and then with Peter Parham at Stanford University, where she discovered that the clathrin protein controls intracellular transport important for HLA stimulation of immune responses. Brodsky then joined Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems as a Programme Manager, where she ran her own lab for four years before becoming an Assistant Professor at UCSF. Brodsky was awarded tenure in 1994, and was a full professor at UCSF until 2014, when she joined UCL. Prof. Brodsky has served as a member and chair of numerous boards, study sections, and advisory committees for organisations such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Pew Scholars Program. In 2000, Brodsky co-founded the scientific journal Traffic, which specialises in intracellular transport, and now serves as Reviews Editor.

The research efforts of the Sligar laboratory have several foci. A common thread is the development and utilization of novel technologies to understand the central mechanisms of biological function at the molecular and cellular level. A major effort is in the physical and chemical means by which enzymes catalyze biological oxidations. One research focus is on the cytochrome P450 dependent mixed function oxidases playing central and crucial roles in mammalian, plant, insect, viral, and microbial metabolism. Central questions relating to the mechanisms of these important biological oxidations include the precise chemistry involved in activation of oxygen and substrate and the identity of metal-oxygen-carbon intermediates in the catalytic event, the detailed physical description of inter- and intra-protein electron and proton transfer, and the structure of multi-enzyme membrane complexes involved in catalytic oxygenation and redox movement. A second important research direction for our group is the development and execution of methodologies for and the determination of biological structures in the 5 nm - 500 nm 'mesoscale' size range. A major breakthrough in this arena continues to be the development of the Nanodisc system. Here chemical self-assembly is used to generate discoidal phospholipids bilayers, 6-20 nm in diameter, which are soluble in aqueous solution and can contain a variety of membrane protein targets. We have succeeded in incorporating a multitude of integral membrane proteins including many G-protein coupled receptors, various P450 monoxygenases and a variety of receptors and integrin assemblies. Most interesting is the fact that the incorporated membrane proteins are fully functional, including faithful reproduction of the complicated processes of trans membrane signaling. We use the Nanodisc system for both the discovery of new pharmacological agents as well as the therapeutic delivery of small molecule and protein based therapeutics. D'Antona A. M., Xie G., Sligar S.

Limb regeneration proceeds by formation of the limb blastema, a mound of mesenchymal stem cells. The distinctive questions center around the origin and identity of the blastema. How does it arise by reprogramming of differentiated cells at the amputation plane? How is growth of the blastema regulated by the requirement for concomitant regeneration of peripheral nerves? How is the positional identity of blastemal cells determined ? Recent work has identified molecules that are implicated in positional identity and nerve dependence. This has also provided an explanation of how nerve dependence is established in the development of the limb. Our interest in reprogramming in this context centers on the regulation of tumor suppressor genes in regeneration which seems to be critical for the early stages. The most difficult questions of all are to understand regeneration as an evolutionary variable. Why can a salamander regenerate its limb and why does a mammal lack this ability? Our evidence from molecular phylogeny suggests that regeneration may have evolved locally in salamanders, rather than being a purely ancestral mechanism. This viewpoint of local evolution is strongly supported by recent transcriptomic and proteomic analysis by other laboratories. This is turn raises questions about the roles of salamander-specific gene products, and suggests new strategies for promoting regeneration in mammals. I received my PhD at Edinburgh University in molecular biology. After post-doctoral periods in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard (with Zach Hall), and the Department of Zoology at UCL (with Martin Raff), I joined the Division of Biology at Caltech in 1978 as an Assistant Professor. I returned to the UK to the MRC Biophysics Unit at KCL in 1983, then the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, and since 1998 the Department of Biochemistry at UCL \u2013 now renamed Structural and Molecular Biology. Since 1997 I have held Programme Grant support from the MRC as well as a concurrent MRC Research Professorship. I was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1994. My initial interests as an independent investigator were in cellular interactions in the mammalian peripheral nervous system, and led to an antibody-based method for purifying cultured Schwann cells, and the identification of Glial Growth Factor (GGF), an early member of the neuregulin family. I became interested in salamander regeneration, particularly limb regeneration, at Caltech and I have worked on several different aspects, always from a basic science perspective.", "tag": "aspirant"},

We screen to develop a large database, and use simple follow-on assays and bioinformatics to identify small molecule biomodulators likely to exhibit a previously undescribed mode of action. Using this approach we identified an exceptionally promising first-in-class preclinical anticancer drug and a previously undescribed conserved pathway of hormone action. The endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress sensor, the unfolded protein response (UPR), was known as a pathway that reacts to diverse forms of stress by activating signaling pathways that reduce protein production and increase protein-folding capacity. From our novel screening strategy, we showed that the steroid hormone estrogen bound to estrogen receptor (ER) very rapidly activates a different kind of UPR pathway that is activated in the absence of cell stress and anticipates a future need for increased protein folding capacity. Demonstrating relevance in humans, analysis of bioinformatic data from approximately 1,000 ER positive breast cancers shows that elevated expression of a UPR gene signature at diagnosis is a powerful new prognostic marker tightly correlated with subsequent tumor recurrence, therapy resistance and poor survival. This newly unveiled pathway of hormone action is conserved from insects to humans and between steroid hormones and peptide hormones. An important focus of our research is to understand how the very rapid hormone activation of the anticipatory UPR pathway couples to and authorizes subsequent actions of estrogen, the oncogenic hormone, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and other hormones, and how activation of this pathway protects cancer cells. Estrogen, acting via ER, drives proliferation of more than 70% of human breast cancers. Recent studies show that therapies that target estrogen and ER often select for ER mutations D538G and Y537S. Using our modifications of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing protocols, we isolated multiple breast cancer cell lines in which both copies of the wild type ER gene were replaced with ERD538G or ERY537S. This was perhaps the first example of using CRISPR to replace both copies of a wild type gene with a mutant gene in a cancer cell. In our biologically relevant anchorage independent 3-dimensional culture system, the ERD538G and ERY537S cells exhibit robust proliferation without estrogen and are resistant to current therapies. The molecular and biochemical basis for estrogen-independent, drug-resistant, growth of these cancer cells is a focus of current research. Cancer therapies that target estrogen production or binding to ER in breast cancer often select for resistance. Although many ovarian cancers contain ER, these highly lethal tumors do not respond to therapies targeting ER. Using our novel screening and drug development approach, we identified BHPI, a potent first-in-class non-competitive ER biomodulator that kills therapy-resistant ER positive cancer cells in cell culture and induces rapid and dramatic regression of breast cancers in mouse models. Notably, BHPI kills the ERY537S and ERD538G cells that are resistant to current therapies. BHPI is so effective because it works by hyperactivating the anticipatory UPR pathway described above, converting it from protective to toxic. Ovarian cancers are so lethal because they develop resistance to chemotherapy, often through overexpression of hard-to-target drug efflux pumps. Its novel mode of action enables BHPI to reverse multidrug resistance in ER positive ovarian cancer and reduce tumor mass and serum markers to undetectable levels. With our strong team of collaborators we are working to move BHPI forward toward clinical trials.

Embedded within the external skeleton formed by higher order \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures, the internal catalytic sites in various P450s are defined by a series of varying length loop sequences (designated as substrate recognition sequences (SRS)) that specify the size of the catalytic site and orientation of compounds over the catalytic heme. In the correct orientation and in proximity to the catalytically important I-helix, substrates incorporate the heme-bound oxygen through a reaction cycle that utilizes electrons transferred from P450 reductase and cytochrome b . In the incorrect orientation, inhibitors position themselves within the catalytic site, block the reaction cycle and interfere with substrate oxygenation. From biochemical perspectives, the ability to incorporate oxygen at very specific points in a substrate\u2019s structure is essential to numerous synthetic and catabolic pathways that utilize simple alkyl and aromatic hydroxylations or more complex epoxidations, aryl migrations, decarboxylations and carbon-carbon bond cleavages. Because of the involvement of P450s in many critical metabolic conversions, the restricted substrate specificity of many plant and insect monooxygenases and the chemical versatility of the entire group of monoxygenases have generated significant interest in defining functions for those not yet characterized, in understanding catalytic site constraints of those in biologically important pathways and in modifying them for crop improvement and biopharmaceutical production. From genomics and evolutionary perspectives, these types of goals are especially challenging since plant P450 gene families have duplicated and diverged to unprecedented degrees as new pathways have evolved for the synthesis of plant defense toxins and other secondary metabolites. From functional and transcriptional perspectives, these goals are also challenged by the fact that closely related P450s sometimes vary in only a few catalytic site residues affecting their substrate specificities and their genes may vary in only a few promoter elements affecting their expression patterns. Our research projects in this area are focused on defining the functions and structures of a variety of plant P450s with biological roles important in the production of defense toxins, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids and signaling molecules as well as insect P450s with biological roles in the destruction of plant defense toxins and synthetic insecticides. With many P450s being integral to the synthetic and detoxicative functions in these organisms, we have sought to better define the biochemical parameters dictating the substrate specificities of individual P450s, the molecular programs defining their transcriptional responses to internal and external cues and the genomic events enabling their acquisition of novel biochemical functions. Bringing together structural, biochemical and genomics perspectives into a comprehensive view of each P450 being studied, we have focused on developing and interfacing computational and biochemical technologies important for understanding, defining and manipulating P450 functions, irrespective of their plant, insect or vertebrate origin. Stepping beyond the phylogenetic primary sequence alignments most frequently used to assign P450 nomenclature, we have developed and improved molecular modeling protocols allowing us to more accurately predict three-dimensional structures for plant and insect P450s based on available mammalian P450 crystal structures (Baudry et al., 2006; Rupasinghe and Schuler, 2006). We have also developed low-throughput and high-throughput docking procedures for predictions of a compound\u2019s binding mode within various catalytic sites. Interfacing computational predictions of protein structure and substrate binding mode with biochemical reality, we have optimized several heterologous expression systems for production of P450s, P450 reductase and cytochrome b (Duan and Schuler, 2006) and utilized these for defining biochemical functions of individual P450s. Among our available systems, baculovirus-mediated insect cell expression has been used for substrate binding and activity analyses, inhibitor analyses and scaled-up product characterizations, yeast expression has been used for substrate activity analyses and metabolic engineering, and bacterial expression has been used for metabolic engineering and scaled-up production for crystallization trials and isotopic labelings. Our biochemical analyses, which are tied back to computational predictions and forward to evolutionary analyses, support our structure predictions by generating and testing numerous catalytic site, proximal surface and membrane anchor mutants. Together, these data have provided for very thorough appreciations of the catalytic site and proximal surface residues modulating P450 activities and substrate ranges. Incorporating these computational and biochemical perspectives with the genomics perspectives needed to understand the physiological roles of specific P450s, we have used a variety of techniques to detail and manipulate a range of plant P450 transcripts expressed in response to abiotic and biotic stresses and insect P450 transcripts expressed in response to natural and synthetic toxins. Providing perspective on the types of biological systems that we are currently studying, these include: P450s have focused on defining biochemical and physiological functions for the subfamilies mediating metabolisms of fatty acids, phenylpropanoids and defense toxins. Molecular modeling, substrate docking and biochemical analysis have allowed us to detail the catalytic site conservations and differences between members of the CYP86 and CYP94 families that modulate hydroxylations on nonoxygenated vs. oxygenated fatty acids (Rupasinghe et al., 2007) and members of the CYP98A subfamily that modulate hydroxylations on lignin precursors. Biochemical analyses tied to functional analyses of T-DNA knockouts have allowed us to describe the developmental and stress-related effects of inactivating particular P450 transcripts defined previously in microarray analyses, we have begun analyzing the circadian fluctuations of individual genes to determine the range of P450 transcripts affected by the circadian clock and the extent to which stress signaling cascades swamp normal cyclical variations. Our analyses have demonstrated that many P450 transcripts in the flavonoid, carotenoid, brassinosteroid, jasmonate and glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways are circadian-regulated (Pan et al., 2009), including several capable of responding to jasmonic acid and other biotic stress signaling molecules. Transcript analyses at varying times in the circadian cycle have shown that, for several P450 genes, the magnitudes of their inducibilities change throughout the day in response to stress signaling molecules indicating that the responses of some biosynthetic pathways vary with and, sometimes, supercede the circadian cycle. Bioinformatics analysis has allowed us to identify over-represented promoter motifs in those responding to both circadian and stress signaling cues and these are being tested for functionality (honey bee) have focused on identifying those capable of detoxifying natural plant toxins and understanding their relationships to those detoxifying synthetic insecticides. Our work with many of these insect P450s combines expression in heterologous systems with molecular modeling to predict and define the range of compounds metabolized by individual P450 sequences and to determine the effects of allelic variations on catalytic activities toward various classes of plant compounds and insecticides. These analyses have provided concrete evidence for the convergent evolution of P450s involved in the detoxification of plant compounds and insecticides (Li et al., 2004, 2007; Rupasinghe et al., 2007; Chiu et al., 2008) and highlighted the importance of avoiding repeated insecticide selections. For others, these analyses have provided evidence for selective evolution in some P450 catalytic sites that have restricted access to the heme oxygen and directed metabolism toward highly select groups of plant toxins or that have varied proximal surface residues to enhance interactions with critical electron transfer partners needed for activity (Mao et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). CYP6Z subfamily, which are over-expressed in insecticide-resistant stock strains, have provided information on a range of catalytic site and proximal surface changes that have potential to affect enzymatic functions. In conjunction with these studies, we are using high-throughput computational screening to identify inhibitors for several P450s capable of metabolizing insecticides and likely to mediate the acquisition of insecticide resistance in various mosquito populations. Other projects have begun characterizing the small collection of 46 honey bee P450s and identified several in the expanded CYP6AS subfamily that metabolize quercitin, the main flavonoid in honey and pollen (Mao et al., 2009). Several involved in the metabolism of the insecticide tau-fluvalinate have also been identified. Projects in biopharmaceutically-important P450s are focused on identifying plant P450s and their associated proteins involved in the synthesis of important anti-cancer and anti-viral alkaloids in , two medicinal plants. With many parts of the complex alkaloid synthetic pathways in these plants containing P450s whose protein expression characteristics have not yet been tested in bacterial and yeast systems, we have begun cloning and optimizing expression of components in the early and late alkaloid pathways. Protein candidates for these components are being identified by bioinformatic and computational assessments of transcriptome profiles that have recently become available for these medicinal plants. With structural and biochemical analyses of individual candidates completed, future projects with our collaborators will focus on engineering of complete pathways in yeast and bacteria. Projects in this area are focused on coupling molecular modeling, protein expression and solid-state NMR capabilities to define the backbone structures for plant and human P450s. For these, full-length P450s (including their hydrophobic membrane anchor) are expressed in E. coli under conditions suitable for uniformly-labeling proteins with N amino acids. Interfacing of scored molecular models with experimental solid-state NMR data has provided us and our collaborators with the ability to discriminate between good and bad P450 models and to significantly enhance structure determinations from solid-state NMR datasets. Projects in this area are focused on defining the range of splicing factors mediating constitutive and alternative splicing during plant growth and development. Using T-DNA knockout/knockout lines and RNA silencing lines depleted for different classes of splicing factors, we have been characterizing the roles of a number of second-step splicing factors as well as general splicing factors. We are particularly interested in the second-step splicing factors since they are encoded by multiple divergent genes that have potential to differentially regulate splicing, in contrast to those in yeast and humans that are encoded by single genes. Additional projects have begun to examine the stress responses of the second-step splicing factors and to determine whether some of these alter splice site choices in the stressed plant cells. acting factors involved in the recognition of plant AU rich introns and, in the long run, help define the optimal sequences needed to express transgenes and transgenic proteins in heterologous plants.

This includes receptors that shift between active and resting states, transporters that alternate access to a substrate binding site from one side of the membrane to the other, and proteins that bring two membrane together during membrane fusion. To understand protein behavior, biochemists frequently introduce mutations, perhaps to lock a receptor in an active state, or change the energy barriers between outwards and inwards facing states of a transporter. A detailed understanding of how amino acid sequence informs protein biophysical behavior can help determine protein mechanism and assist in engineering proteins with altered properties. But where should one begin? What mutations will increase protein activity? What mutations will shift the equilibria between protein conformational states? The Procko lab has developed 'Big Data' tools for deep mutational scanning of transmembrane proteins in mammalian cells. By combining in vitro evolution with deep sequencing, it becomes possible to characterize the phenotypes of thousands of receptor mutants in a single experiment, and a comprehensive sequence-fitness landscape of a protein can be experimentally determined. Mutations can then be identified that alter protein activity, with a particular focus on finding mutations that drive proteins into specific conformations. We are currently focused on three membrane protein systems: neurotransmitter transporters associated with psychiatric disease, G protein-coupled receptors in the immune and nervous systems (including receptors for taste, chemokines and HIV-1 entry), and the HIV-1 envelope fusion protein.

Our laboratory uses classical biochemical and microbiological techniques, in combination with biophysical methods (in particular X-ray crystallography) to decipher how microbes utilize small molecules to establish ecological niches, and combat against the colonization of antagonistic species that may compete for limited resources. This research focus is predicated upon the notion that knowledge of such interactions drives the discovery and development of natural products that can be used to combat the growth of pathogenic bacteria. : A main research focus in our laboratory is on biosynthetic enzymes that modify ribosomally encoded peptides to yield macrocyclic natural products. We are specifically focused on understanding the mechanism for the synthesis of two classes of such compounds: lantibiotics and cyanobactins. For both classes of natural products, the genetic nature of the precursor and the modular architecture of the modification/processing enzymes may be exploited to yield novel molecules with improved therapeutic applications. Our work on lantibiotics, in collaboration with the van der Donk laboratory (Chemistry: UIUC), has been aimed at characterization of several enzymes involved in biosynthesis. Our work on cyanobactin, in collaboration with Eric Schmidt (Medicinal Chemistry: Utah) focuses on structure-function characterization of enzymatic pathways for the production of these heterocyclized macrocyclic marine natural products. : We are members of the Mining Microbial Genomes theme within the Institute of Genomic Biology (van Der Donk: Chemistry, Metcalf: Microbiology and Zhao: Chemical Engineering). In collaboration with the members of this theme, we are focused on characterization of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phosphonate antibiotics, with the aim of using the structural data to reprogram these enzymes to produce novel compounds. : Bacteria can utilize small molecules as signals and we are focusing on elucidating the mechanisms underlying this process. In quorum sensing, bacteria coordinate population growth by utilizing small molecule inducers (typically acylhomoserine lactones). When the population density exceeds some threshold, these autoinducers bind to their cognate receptor and activate the transcription of various genes. A second class of inter-cellular communication is predicated upon the action of a diffusible signal factors that are chemically distinct from quorum sensing autoinducers. These classes of compounds activate the production or degradation of a second messenger, cyclic diguanylate (or cyclic di-GMP) that act as downstream effectors for various signaling pathways. In theory, as each of these pathways are regulated by small molecules, they represent ideal targets for therapeutic intervention against bacterial growth.

The nature of these enzymes suggests that they may be involved in cancer by acting either as anti-oncogenes or as oncogenes themselves. There is also evidence to suggest that PTPases are involved in mammalian development. Our research interest has focused on three recently cloned enzymes and their relationship to mouse development and cancer. One of these PTPases, termed MPTP, is a ubiquitously expressed PTPase which localizes to the cell nucleus and may play a role in cell cycle events. MPTP-PEST is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic enzyme which has been implicated in intracellular signal transduction. PTP NU-3 is a neuronal-cell specific PTPase which belongs to the receptor-type family of enzymes and is thought to play a role in neurogenesis by interacting with the extracellular matrix. Our lab employs a variety of tools in the analysis of these PTPases. These include: cloning and identification of tissue specific and developmentally regulated PTPases; identification of substrates, associated proteins, and extracellular ligands; creation of temperature sensitive enzymes and cell lines; and the analysis of the gene expression pattern during mouse development.

There are typically up to twenty different types of tRNA synthetases in the cytoplasm of each cell. Each is responsible for a single cognate amino acid and covalently attaches it to the correct tRNA. The \"charged\" tRNA then acts as a shuttle to deliver the amino acid to the ribosome where it can be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Because the tRNA synthetases are essential to every cell, their investigation has potential to address basic research questions and also target important long-term medical issues such as antibiotic discovery and development. New tRNA synthetases can also be designed to incorporate novel amino acids into custom-designed proteins for use as tools and/or therapeutics in biotechnology and medical applications. Our research in tRNA synthetases currently focuses in two broad areas: . Some tRNA synthetases make mistakes and fail to distinguish between closely related amino acids. However, these tRNA synthetases have evolved mechanisms to proofread their errors and edit their mistakes. One of our research goals is to determine mechanistic details and molecular interactions that govern tRNA synthetase aminoacylation and amino acid editing activities. We have made considerable progress in this area using leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) as a model. The LeuRS editing active site resides within a discretely folded domain that is called CP1 and is distinct from the aminoacylation active site. Using combinations of biochemical, structural, computational and genetic approaches, we have localized and begun to map the amino acid editing active site and also the aminoacylation active site. Our research has identified molecular determinants that dictate specificity and also influence LeuRS enzymatic activity. Significantly, we have also been able to block the amino acid editing activity, which allows us to activate and stably charge unnatural amino acids to tRNA. These \"mischarged\" tRNAs can be used to expand the genetic code by introducing novel amino acids into proteins. . The tRNA synthetases are thought to be one of the most ancient families of proteins. Because of their lengthy evolutionary period, they have often been adopted for other activities in the cell that extend beyond their role in aminoacylation and protein synthesis. A second focus of our research group is to understand the molecular basis of tRNA synthetases in alternate and novel roles that are also essential to the cell. In particular, we have focused upon a yeast mitochondrial group I intron splicing reaction that requires LeuRS. The LeuRS works in collaboration with a second protein called the bI4 maturase to aid the bI4 intron splicing reaction. We have determined that the CP1 editing domain of LeuRS can also function as an independent splicing factor and possibly suggests that some determinants for amino acid editing and splicing might overlap. We are currently investigating and characterizing specific regions and also amino acids that influence the LeuRS-dependent splicing reaction. Boniecki, M.T. and Martinis, S.A.

The specific focus of the lab is on the antigen-specific receptor expressed by T lymphocytes (T cell receptor, TCR). The TCR is an \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer that recognizes foreign peptides that are bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Foreign peptides can be derived from viral or bacterial antigens or in some cases from tumor associated antigens. For example, cytotoxic T cells recognize and kill tumor cells that express on their surface peptides bound to class I products of the MHC. Down regulation of the peptide/class I complex is one mechanism that tumor cells use to escape recognition and destruction. It has also become clear that the aberrant reactivities of some \u03b1&beta TCRs can have severe autoimmune consequences. Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are two examples of diseases that involve the activity of T cells. Studies of the molecular processes involved in the expression of the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR and the biochemical interactions between the TCR and its ligands are essential to understanding and eventually controlling such detrimental responses. A complete understanding of T cell recognition will require knowledge about the binding properties of T cell receptors. Unfortunately, the major limitation to such biochemical analyses has been the lack of pure receptor protein. Our lab has engineered a \"single-chain receptor\" gene (scTCR) that contains the V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 genes from a T cell clone linked by a gene that encodes a flexible peptide. The scTCR has been overexpressed in 27 kD) has been identified. Our goals are to use these recombinant proteins to: 1) evaluate the binding affinities and specificities of the TCR, 2) use site-directed mutagenesis to map the binding site of the TCR, and 3) correlate the energy of TCR-peptide/MHC interactions with biological function. In another project, the TCR has been displayed on the surface of yeast cells. The yeast display system has been used to evolve more stable forms of the soluble TCR and to evolve TCR with higher affinities for their ligands. These high affinity TCRs have been used 1) to study the relationship between T cell function and TCR:ligand binding kinetics, 2) as probes for the presence of peptide-MHC complexes on tumor cells, 3) to inhibit undesirable T cell activity, and 4) to elucidate the structural contributions of different interactions to binding affinity. Finally, our lab is interested in engineering other proteins of immunological interest. These include the class I and class II MHC proteins, NK receptors, and antibodies against various T cell surface molecules. Proteins engineered for greater stability and higher affinity will be used to examine various structural and biochemical properties of the proteins, in addition to develop possible novel therapeutic agents.

Our major goal is to capitalize on these insights and apply them as therapeutic approaches for tissue regeneration and repair. We employ tissue-specific knockout/transgenic mouse models, biochemistry, and genome-wide molecular approaches (RNA-seq and iCLIP) to define the post-transcriptional regulatory networks that coordinate developmental and regenerative programs. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene produces multiple polypeptides with potentially different functions. Over 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced giving rise to greater than 100,000 proteins from less than 20,000 genes. Due to tight spatiotemporal control, alternative splicing not only generates an extremely diverse proteome but also directs its regulated expression in response to a wide range of cues. Importantly, splicing defects are now recognized as central to many human diseases including neurological disorders, muscular dystrophies and cancer. In this project we are systematically investigating the role of alternative splicing in mammalian heart and liver tissue development. We are also utilizing modified antisense oligonucleotides to investigate the phenotypic consequences of individual mRNA processing events on liver physiology and function. The liver carries out a large number of physiological processes, and is therefore, indispensable for organismal survival. Although the human liver possesses an exceptional ability to regenerate, it often fails to repair itself during many liver disorders. We have recently identified a developmentally regulated splicing network in mice that is redeployed during adult liver regeneration. The major goal of this project is to delineate the mechanisms that are instrumental in re-initiating the developmental splicing program in response to liver injury. These studies will provide important insights into how quiescent stem cells and hepatic progenitors may be instructed to proliferate or differentiate to combat different liver disorders. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant, multi-systemic neuromuscular disorder that is a common cause of congenital and adult onset muscular dystrophy. The causative mutation is a CTG expansion in the 3\u2019-UTR of DMPK gene resulting in aberrant expression of CUG repeat containing RNA that accumulates in nuclear foci, depletes a splicing regulatory protein, MBNL1, and causes misregulation of developmentally regulated alternative splicing. From a global screen in a heart-specific and inducible DM1 mouse model, we have recently discovered a specific defect in Mef2 transcriptional program in DM1 that results in loss of expression of its target genes including scores of cardiac microRNAs. We are currently optimizing different therapeutic approaches to correct microRNA misregulation in DM1 cell culture and mouse models. In collaboration with Steve Zimmerman and Paul Hergenrother labs, (UIUC), we are also testing the in vivo efficacy of their small molecule inhibitors that can release Mbnl1 from the CUG RNA in a DM1 mouse model. As transcription terminates, the 3\u2019-end of most eukaryotic mRNAs is cleaved and polyadenylated. Polyadenylation adds a 3\u2019-poly(A) tail that is bound by the poly(A)-binding proteins to regulate mRNA stability, localization and translation. More than 50% of mammalian genes use alternative poly(A) sites, which affect the mRNA\u2019s accessibility to regulatory factors including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins. While the choice of poly(A) site(s) selection is tightly regulated during development, the key determinative factors affecting this process are largely unknown. We are currently studying the regulatory programs that control alternative polyadenylation during mouse heart development.

We are interested in applying a chemical biology approach to three research areas: (I) The first is to dissect and further elucidate the process of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Small molecule ligands, acting as inhibitors, have provided formidable insight into the complexity of prokaryotic translation. We propose that similar inhibitors of eukaryotic translation will be valuable tools to better understand the intricacies and regulation of this pathway. Moreover, only from a more complete picture of eukaryotic protein synthesis can one obtain the necessary means to design therapies that target translation to treat disease. In sum, our research program is aimed at identifying inhibitors of mammalian translation, elucidating their mode of action, and identifying their molecular targets. (II) The increasing awareness of the essential role of RNA in many biological processes and in the progression of disease makes it a very attractive therapeutic target. RNA plays an essential role in many macromolecular processes (sometimes contributing catalytic activity), contains complex secondary and tertiary structural folds, and lacks a cellular repair mechanism. Targeting RNA has also the potential to regulate gene expression in fashions not available by current drug strategy approaches - for example, to achieve allele-specific modulation of gene expression (when allelic sequence differences result in altered RNA conformations) or isoform-specific modulation of gene expression. One of our research efforts is to target specific RNA motifs involved in disease with small molecule ligands to perturb gene expression. (III) We are also interested in better understanding changes in gene expression that occur during the transformation process. We have been characterizing the biochemical properties of a tumor suppressor gene, WT1, a gene that is mutated in Wilms' tumor - a pediatric malignancy of the kidney. As such we have characterized structure/function relationships of WT1, characterized several of its downstream targets, and shown a role for the product of this gene in normal urogenital development. We have also characterized genetic events involved in the progression of this disease.

Protein synthesis and its regulation are essential for gene regulation. For all organisms, protein synthesis takes place in the ribosome, a remarkable molecular machine in all cells. Protein synthesis is mainly regulated at the initiation and the termination stages where the ribosome is complexed with cellular regulatory and translational protein factors to function. Translation directly influences important cellular processes such as development, differentiation, growth, cell fitness and cellular adaptive responses to the external environment. Consequently, regulatory dysfunction in translation results in numerous diverse human diseases including metabolic disorders, neuronal degenerative diseases and cancer. We are pursuing the molecular understanding of translation and its regulation using biochemical, genomic, and biophysical methods with an emphasis on macromolecule crystallography. The major pathway for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is the cap-dependent pathway,which recruits a set of protein initiation factors to mRNAs that have 5\u2019 m G caps. However, under certain cellular conditions, such as variations of the cell cycle, developmental patterning, cellular responses to external perturbations and diseases, cells down-regulate cap-dependent translation, and instead, selectively translate subsets of mRNA via an alternative, cap-independent translational pathway. The mRNAs translated in the cap-independent pathway often contain sequence-specific and/or structure-specific regions in their 5\u2019-untranslated regions (5\u2019-UTRs) that recruit translation factors, regulatory proteins and translational machinery in a highly coordinated way. The cap-independent translation is critical to cell\u2019s ability to adapt to the environment and cell survival. We are investigating the mechanism, function and regulation of cap-independent translation at both genomic and molecular levels. We are probing the translational status of the cell at a genome-wide scale using high-throughput mRNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling techniques. In parallel, we are using biochemistry, genetics and structural biology to study how translational apparatuses are assembled and what their structures and functions are in the cap-independent translation pathway. Ribosomes translate genetic information encoded in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins in all cells. It is a large RNA-protein complex with a molecular weight of about 2.5MDa in bacteria. All ribosomes consist of two asymmetrical subunits that perform different, but closely coupled functions: the small subunit decodes the genetic information in the mRNA; and the large subunit synthesizes and releases the protein by catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds and the release of nascent proteins from the ribosome. To ensure the speed and accuracy of protein synthesis, ribosomes orchestrate different scales of conformational rearrangements: from localized conformational changes of specific essential residues to global conformational rearrangements that involve the inter-subunit rotation. We have identified a new crystal form that can accommodate the bacteria ribosome complexed with translational GTPases, when the two ribosomal subunits rotate relative to each other. We are using X-ray crystallographic techniques to study ribosomal complexes along the translational pathway with a focus on the translational termination. A molecular understanding of the bacterial ribosome at the atomic-level detail will provide valuable information for designing antibacterial targets as well as reprogramming translation to probe fundamental questions on the origin and evolution of life.

FLCN was identified as an AMPK binding partner, and we demonstrated that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of AMPK. Loss of FLCN constitutively activated AMPK, resulting in PGC-1\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, increased ROS production, which induced HIF transcriptional activity and drove Warburg metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming stimulated cellular bioenergetics and conferred a HIF-dependent tumorigenic advantage in FLCN-negative cancer cells. Moreover, using Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, we showed that loss of FLCN results in constitutive AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy, inhibition of apoptosis, enhanced cellular bioenergetics, and resistance to energy-depleting stresses including oxidative stress, heat, anoxia, and serum deprivation. We further showed that AMPK activation conferred by FLCN loss is independent of the cellular energy state suggesting that FLCN controls the AMPK energy sensing ability. Together, our data suggest that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of AMPK signaling that acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AMPK function. We are now studying the mechanism of FLCN inhibition with respect to AMPK sensing activity as well as the effect of FLCN loss and AMPK activation in tumor progression in various human cancers. 2) Role of ESCRT component HD-PTP/PTPN23 in cancer - Components of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) have long been proposed to act as tumor suppressors. PTPN23 or HD-PTP, an ESCRT associated protein, is located on 3p21.3, a region frequently deleted in many human malignancies. Previously, we have demonstrated that HD-PTP is a catalytically inactive PTP due to an evolutionary conserved divergence in its phosphatase domain. Using a mouse model we showed that HD-PTP is expressed in all epithelial tissues and that homozygous deletion of Ptpn23 is embryonic lethal at day 9.5. We are now characterizing various cancer phenotypes in this mouse model to elucidate the function of HD-PTP in tumorigenesis. We are also studying the effect of HD-PTP depletion on cell surface receptor trafficking, by elucidating the molecular determinants of endocytosed receptors targeting for recycling or lysosomal delivery such as receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination. ESCRT machinery is responsible for lysosomal targeting of ubiquitinated receptors, which leads to their signal abrogation. Therefore, depletion of ESCRT components is likely to result in enhanced recycling and downstream signalling of receptors escaping degradation, potentially leading to enhanced tumor initiation and progression.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Research in Huang laboratory focuses on studies of protein enzymes that act on essential RNAs involved in protein translation. Based on the effect of these enzymes, the research can be divided into three specific areas. A variety of toxins target protein translation apparatus for cell killing. The biggest group among them is perhaps ribotoxins, which cleave essential RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs) to inhibit protein translation. It is estimated that tens of thousands of ribotoxins are produced by organisms from all three domains, but only a small fraction of them has been characterized. Our research in this area focuses on discovery, biochemical and structural characterization of novel ribotoxins that inhibit protein translation. To counter RNA damage inflicted by ribotoxins, some organisms employ protein enzymes to repair the damaged RNAs for self-defense. Several years ago, our laboratory discovered the first bacterial RNA repair system. The system, which is composed of two proteins named Pnkp and Hen1, not only repairs the damaged RNAs, but also immunizes the repaired RNAs to prevent them from future damage. Through bioinformatics, we have recently found additional new RNA repair systems, and their functional characterization is currently underway. Various RNAs, tRNA in particular, are subject to extensive post-transcriptional modifications. To date, more than 100 modified nucleosides have been found in RNA. It is well documented that modifications in tRNAs, especially those near the anticodon, affect efficiency and accuracy of protein translation.

However when these pathways are altered in cancer cells, this acts to enhance cell invasion the first step of metastasis. Our aims are to identify what signal transduction pathways are important for the development of human cancers and how these can be targeted with drug therapies. This is a complex question that requires a full understanding of how signals are integrated in normal cells and how these signals become altered in tumor cells, in the context of other genetic alterations. My lab has focused on and will continue to address these questions using the Met receptor tyrosine kinase and oncogene as a model. We will focus on signals required for anchorage independent growth, morphological cell transformation, epithelial mesenchymal transition, cell invasion and tumorigenesis. Deregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases in human cancers can occur through positive activation of the receptor or through the loss of negative regulatory controls. We have identified that Cbl a ubiquitin ligase acts as a negative regulatory signal for the Met receptor. We will establish the molecular mechanism through which Cbl negatively regulates the Met receptor and establish if this is a mechanism for receptor deregulation in human cancers. We will exploit the use of substrate specific variants of the Met receptor to dissect signaling pathways essential for tumor induction and metastasis and will dissect signals that promote tumor angiogenesis.

OMP decarboxylase, the penultimate step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, is one of Nature\u2019s most efficient catalysts.

We also are studying the structural mechanism by which the \u201cintrinsic binding energy\u201d associated with the 5\u2019-phosphate group of the substrate is used to enhance catalysis. The OMP decarboxylase suprafamily includes not only OMP decarboxylase but also 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase and D-arabino-hex-3-ulose 6-phosphate synthase. In contrast to OMP decarboxylase, both utilize Mg to stabilize an enolate anion intermediate. The active site residues are remarkably conserved in the suprafamily, although the mechanisms of the reactions are not conserved. The growing sequence databases now appear to contain novel members of the suprafamily that likely catalyze \u201cnew\u201d reactions; the discovery of these reactions is under investigation. As the sequence databases expand (now, >11,000,000 unique protein sequences are contained in the TrEMBL database), we are wanting to identify members of all three superfamilies that have unknown functions--these are determined in genome projects without regard to biological and biochemical function. Indeed, functional assignment of proteins of unknown function is a major challenge in postgenomic biology that is limiting both understanding the scope of Nature\u2019s diversity and, also, exploiting that diversity for biomedical and industrial applications. To address this problem, we are leading two NIH funded projects that are developing an integrated sequence/structure based strategy to predict the substrates (and, therefore, functions) of unknown members of functionally diverse enzyme superfamilies that are discovered in genome projects. In these multidisciplinary projects, experts in functional biology (mechanistic enzymology), structural biology (X-ray crystallography), computational biology (bioinformatics, modeling, and in silico ligand docking), and microbiology (genetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) are brought together to address the problem of functional assignment of unknown proteins. This multidisciplinary approach reflects the intellectual and practical demands of assigning functions to unknown/uncharacterized enzymes. A Program Project (P01GM071790, \u201cDeciphering Enzyme Specificity\u201d) is focused on the functional diverse enolase and amidohydrolase (Frank Raushel, Texas A&M) superfamilies. A new Glue Grant (U54GM093342, \u201cEnzyme Function Initiative\u201d) is additionally focused on the functionally diverse glutathione transferase (Richard Armstrong, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine), haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (Karen Allen, Boston University; Debra Dunaway Mariano, New Mexico), and isoprenoid synthase (Dale Poulter, Utah) superfamilies. Protein production and structure determination is lead by Steve Almo (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Collaborators at UCSF provide expertise in bioinformatics (Patsy Babbitt) and homology modeling/in silico ligand docking (Matt Jacobson, Andrej Sali, and Brian Shoichet). And, John Cronan (genetics) and Jonathan Sweedler (metabolomics) at Illinois are investigating the physiological roles of novel enzymatic activities that are discovered by the in silico and enzymological approaches. The polymeric carbohydrates in plant biomass that are the raw materials for biofuels are contained in a complex matrix. The matrix includes not only crystalline cellulose that is a polymer of glucose (the primary source of biofuels) but also both hemicellulose (a complex, heterogeneous polymer of several carbohydrates) and lignin. Hemicellulose and lignin, together \u201clignocellulose\u201d, prevent access of cellulolytic enzymes to the cellulose, thereby decreasing the efficiency of biofuel production. Industrial approaches for the degradation of lignocellulose have been devised, e.g., treatment with acid, alkali, and/or heat, but these are not particularly efficient or environmentally friendly. The goal of our program is to devise microbiological and biochemical approaches for degradation of lignin so that plant biomass can be more efficiently converted to fuels. Lignin, a complex polymer of phenylpropanoid units, has many types of chemical linkages that provide not only mechanical stability but also resistance to chemical degradation. Because many of the linkages involve stable aromatic structures, drastic nonenzymatic procedures have been used for depolymerization. Strains of Streptomyces have been reported to depolymerize lignin; however, the oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes involved in this process have not been identified. We are focused on discovering and characterizing these novel enzymes because they may provide a more efficient and environmentally friendly approach for lignin depolymerization. The objectives of this program are to 1) to use genome sequences to discover degradative pathways for lignin; 2) mechanistically and structurally characterize the enzymes in those pathways; and 3) design new metabolic pathways so that lignin degradation can be facilitated and biofuel production enhanced. This program is supported by the Energy Biosciences Institute (funded by BP) and also involves John Cronan (Microbiology; microbial physiology and genetics) and Satish Nair (Biochemistry; x-ray structure determination).

We combine a vast array of molecular biology and functional genomic approaches together with tissue culture and mouse models to investigate how alterations in DNA repair and DNA damage responses contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. We study how defects in DNA repair can contribute to tumor initiation and how certain cancer cells become dependent on specific DNA repair pathways. It is generally accepted that defects in DNA repair, whether transient or permanent, contribute to tumor development and progression. Yet, to replicate their DNA and proliferate, cancer cells need DNA repair mechanisms, perhaps even more so than normal cells. Moreover, efficient DNA repair mechanisms can enable cancer cells to resist radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We are entering a new era of cancer research in which patients will be stratified for appropriate therapy on the basis of their DNA repair status, rather than on the tissue of origin, and where combination treatments will include DNA repair inhibitors. The goal of our work is to use the acquired knowledge to exacerbate the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiotherapy and specific chemotherapeutic treatments. In particular, we investigate the molecular and cellular functions of the Cut homeobox 1 (CUX1) gene, a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor gene that is often amplified and overexpressed in advanced cancer. We study which molecular functions of CUX1 protect against cancer and which molecular functions are associated with tumour progression. CUX1 codes for several protein isoforms. Some CUX1 isoforms function as transcriptional activators or repressors, depending on promoter context. Transcriptional activities of CUX1 promote cell cycle progression, DNA replication and DNA damage responses. Another CUX1 isoform which is very abundant functions as an accessory factor in DNA repair and stimulates the efficiency of base excision repair. While this activity in DNA repair protects normal cells against DNA damage and mutations, increased expression of this isoform in cancer cells contributes to their resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In contrast, knockdown of CUX1 expression sensitizes cancer cells to treatments. We are in the process of identifying drugs that inhibit the DNA repair functions of CUX1 with the aim of sensitizing cancer cells to treatments. Sansregret, L., J. Livingstone, C. Vadnais, N.

Membrane fusion at highly specialized microdomains is essential for many cellular processes including hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, membrane repair and antigen presentation. Deciphering the regulation and pathways that lead to microdomain assembly has become central to the deeper understanding of membrane fusion and trafficking. We use a combination of genetics, cell-free biochemistry and microscopy to understand microdomain assembly and membrane fusion. . Because the mechanisms and machinery of membrane fusion are conserved throughout eukaryotes, the vacuole offers an ideal system for our studies. Purified vacuoles bear a full complement of lipids and proteins necessary for fusion and can be easily prepared in large quantities, facilitating high throughput biochemical studies. Vacuoles are also large organelles, facilitating microscopic examination of lipid microdomains and visualization of vacuole docking and fusion. These characteristics, combined with the power of yeast genetics makes the vacuole a superb system for the study of membrane biology. Vacuole fusion occurs at a specialized lipid microdomain called the vertex ring (See below). When vacuoles come into contact at a single point (tethering), they are drawn together and become tightly associated, forming two flattened discs of apposed membrane termed the boundary membrane (docking). The perimeter of the boundary membrane is the vertex ring which becomes enriched in the proteins and lipids that catalyze membrane fusion. These include SNAREs and their chaperones, the Rab Ypt7p and its effector complex HOPS, actin and regulatory lipids including sterols, diacylglycerol and phosphoinositides such as PI(3)P and PI(4,5)P . Fusion only occurs if the vertex ring becomes properly enriched in protein and lipid fusion catalysts. The assembly of proteins and lipids at the vertex ring is highly complex and interdependent. The intricate regulation of these processes are only now beginning to be understood making this a very exciting time in the lab. .

NF-\u03baB signaling and The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates a wide range of host genes that govern the inflammatory and immune responses in mammals. The NF-\u03baB signaling pathway controls multiple key cellular processes, including programmed cell death, cell proliferation, and differentiation. NF-\u03baB is activated by a variety of chemokines, bacteria, viruses and their products via distinct signal transduction pathways mediated by different receptors, including TNF-\u03b1 receptors, Toll-like receptors, and antigen-specific T- and B-cell receptors. The long-term goals of this laboratory are to determine how the NF-\u03baB transcription factor complex is regulated at the molecular level and to elucidate the roles of NF-\u03baB in inflammation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. In particular, we are interested in dissecting how different stimuli converge to activate NF-\u03baB under normal and pathological conditions using a combination of biochemical, molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches. Currently, we are interested in the role of post-translational modifications of NF-\u03baB and histones in the regulation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. While it is clear that post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, play critical roles in shaping the nuclear function of NF-\u03baB, many unanswered questions remain. For example, how do these modifications regulate NF-\u03baB in vivo? Do they contribute significantly to the NF-\u03baBs proinflammatory or anti-apoptotic functions? Is there a \"transcription factor code\" generated by acetylation, phosphorylation, and other modifications? If so, does it mediate the selection of specific target genes or control the strength and duration of the nuclear action of NF-\u03baB? Answering these questions would advance our understanding of how NF-\u03baB is regulated and could also provide exciting new therapeutic options for manipulating NF-\u03baB action in cancer or inflammation. To increase the accessibility of the cell\u2019s transcription and replication machinery to promoters, chromatin remodeling must occur. For example, the conformation of chromatin is altered by chromatin remodeling complexes and the N-terminal tails of histones are modified by enzymes, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, kinases, and methyl transferases. These enzymes play important roles in regulation of gene expression by modifying the histones and thus controlling the accessibility of chromatin by accessory regulator factors. Several of these enzymes interact with NF-\u03baB and regulate NF-\u03baB-dependent transactivation. However, it remains largely unknown whether and how chromatin remodeling mediates NF-\u03baB target gene selection. How are these enzymes regulated in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway? Using different approaches including chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we will identify the enzymes that are recruited to different NF-\u03baB target genes in a stimulus-specific manner and determine how these recruitments are regulated. causes gastritis and peptic ulceration and is the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The mechanisms involved in the bacterium\u2019s ability to induce gastric cancer are believed to be linked to infection-associated chronic gastritis, which is characterized by increased expression of multiple inflammatory genes. Virulence factor CagA of is critical for the infection-initiated inflammation. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB plays a key role in regulating the immune and inflammatory response. Transcriptional activation of NF-\u03baB relies on the proximal cytoplasmic events leading to the activation of IKKs and a series of nuclear events in which NF-\u03baB is post-translationally modified. NF-\u03baB is activated by -associated gastritis. However, the mechanism by which H. pylori utilizes its CagA to activate NF-\u03baB and to promote inflammation-associated gastritis and gastric cancer is not clear. Recently, we demonstrate that CagA physically associates with TAK1 (TGF-\u03b2 activated kinase 1) and enhances the activity of TAK1 and TAK1-induced NF-\u03baB activation via the TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of TAK1. These findings reveal that polyubiquitination of TAK1 regulates the activation of NF-\u03baB and is utilized by Brd4 has emerged as an important factor in regulating many biological processes, including cell cycle, inflammatory response, metabolism and tumorigenesis. We have recently identified bromodomain-containing factor Brd4 as a key regulator of NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory response and cancer development. We have also demonstrated that small molecules inhibiting Brd4 possess strong anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities in cultured cells and in mouse models (Zou et al, , 2016). However, the regulation of Brd4 and its pathophysiological functions remain largely unknown. We are investigating on how Brd4 is regulated in cancer cells and how Brd4 regulates the innate immune response using Brd4 knockout animals. These studies will provide insights into the regulation of Brd4 and whether Brd4 represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer and inflammtory diseases.

Detected in its earliest stages, melanoma is highly curable; however, the 5-year survival rate declines drastically for regional and distant metastatic disease. Recently, melanoma has emerged as the latest success story for both genomics- and immune-guided targeted therapy. Cutaneous melanoma is characterized by hotspot mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulators, BRAF and NRAS, found in approximately 50% and 25% of patients, respectively. The identification of these oncogenic mutations has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting MAPK kinase kinases (MEK) and BRAF in melanoma. Although antitumor responses to MAPK targeted therapies have been dramatic; they are rarely durable. Furthermore, novel therapies targeting inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins have recently shown impressive clinical efficacy; nevertheless, biomarkers that predict response remain unclear. For the past four years, I have led a number of multi-institutional collaborations (Hodis, Watson et al., 2012 Cell), which include The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA, 2015 Cell), to characterize the melanoma genome and perform integrative analysis with multiple data platforms at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Our work has identified a number of novel significantly mutated genes in melanomas, which possess hotspot mutations in coding and non-coding regions. Based on the frequency and correlation of the most frequently significantly mutated genes, we established a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes: mutant BRAF, RAS, NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type) melanomas. To improve on the current diagnostic and treatment modalities employed in the clinic, my lab will address the following questions: What is the biological function and therapeutic relevance of novel significantly mutated genes discovered in our melanoma genome- and exome-sequencing studies? To tackle these problems, my lab will employ computational approaches, in vivo models and biochemical techniques studying patient samples, cell lines, and melanoma mouse models.

We aim to identify novel genes and networks that modulate response to cancer drugs, and to uncover genetic dependencies of cancer-relevant pathways that can be exploited therapeutically. Cancer therapy is often hampered by the rapid emergence of drug resistance. This is true not only for the conventional chemotherapies, but also for genotype-directed drugs targeting those components that are mutated or deregulated in tumor cells. In addition, presence of an oncogenic driver mutation does not always confer sensitivity to the drug that inhibits that driver. Therefore, a better understanding of resistance mechanisms is essential to enable the rational development of treatment strategies to overcome this clinical challenge. Using unbiased functional genetic screens (loss- and gain-of-function), we aim to uncover novel genes and network interactions that causally modulate response to targeted cancer therapeutics. Whenever possible, the expressions of these candidate biomarkers are examined in patient tumour samples to correlate with clinical response to the cancer drugs. Complementary genetic and biochemical approaches are used to investigate the mechanism of action and to provide treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Majority of genotype-directed anticancer drugs target the gain-of-function oncogenic mutations. However, some cancer driver mutations such as loss-of-function alterations in tumour suppressors are not directly actionable. When oncogenic mutations are not directly targetable, \u201csynthetic lethality\u201d is often explored to derive highly specific cancer therapies that have minimal side effects in normal tissue. In this context, we use customized druggable gene-family shRNA/CRISPR libraries and compound collections to identify the targets whose inhibition is synthetic lethal with the driver mutations in the cancer types of interests.

Linear protein molecules must fold into sophisticated three-dimensional structures, and interact with the appropriate cellular targets. In cells, the folding and maturation of proteins depend on a specialized class of proteins termed 'molecular chaperones'. The chaperones are critical for the prevention of protein misfolding and aggregation, which are thought to underlie several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Two of the most important chaperones in the eukaryotic cytosol are Hsp70 and Hsp90, the 70 kDa and 90 kDa heat shock proteins. The function of both chaperones involves interactions with a variety of regulatory co-chaperone proteins whose activities are still poorly understood. My research investigates the biochemical mechanisms of chaperone and co-chaperone activity, and the consequences of this essential activity at a cellular level. Interestingly, Hsp70 and Hsp90 work not only in the folding of soluble proteins, but also help in other cellular processes. These include the targeting of certain precursor proteins to the mitochondria for import into that organelle. Chaperones also work in the regulated assembly or disassembly of protein complexes on other intracellular membranes. It seems that specific co-chaperones are used for the different functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Key questions are how the various co-chaperones direct the activities of the chaperones, for folding and for other purposes, and how chaperone function is integrated into the biogenesis of cellular structures. A combination of biochemistry, molecular and cell biology techniques are being applied to these exciting questions.

Dariusz W\u00f3jcik's current work focuses on the global financial landscape emerging in the wake of the global financial crisis 2007-9. It is based on the premise that the crisis constitutes a major juncture in the history of capitalism, and major changes are necessary in the governance structure of the global economy, as well as in the social scientific approaches to explaining economy. His research combines insights derived from geography, economics, political economy, sociology and anthropology and is based on both quantitative and qualitative research methods, including elite interviews. The topics related closely to the global financial crisis include a review of competing interpretations of the crisis 2007-9; the role of the New York - London axis in the crisis; the role of advanced business services and the offshore world in the transformation of the world economy since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system; and the impact of the financial crisis on financial centres around the world; and the evolution of offshore financial centres and networks. The more theoretical strand involves the future agenda of economic geography, including the intersection of economic geography with post-Keynesian economics, political economy, and accounting, as well as the concept of Global Financial Networks. Other topics include the geography of economic thought, the role of location in the underpricing of Initial Public Offerings on the stock market, the role of financial centres in the international monetary system, and the future of sustainable finance.

Towards this goal, we are studying two distinct processes. Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed, is an absolute requirement for tumour formation. One of our interests is understanding how tumors become vascularized and the mechanisms that can limit this process. Our focus is on the p53 tumour suppressor pathway and how it is able to inhibit angiogenesis. The p53 gene is mutated in half of all human cancers and at least part of its tumour suppression activity stems from inhibiting tumour vascularization. Angiogenesis is regulated through a balance of factors that either promote or inhibit vascularization. Studies from our group demonstrated that p53 stimulates the production of the potent angiogenesis inhibitors Endostatin and Tumstatin. Projects in the lab include the identification of novel p53-induced angiogenesis inhibitors and defining how such factors work. A variety of animal viruses have the ability to kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. Thus, discovering the mechanisms by which these viruses destroy cancer cells could potentially lead to novel pathways that can be exploited for therapy. We use the viral protein Apoptin from Chicken Anemia Virus as a model for understanding tumour-specific cell death. The Apoptin protein has the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis specifically in cancer cells. We demonstrated that Apoptin interacts with and inhibits a large protein complex called the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is absolutely required for cells to progress through mitosis and been shown to be a cellular target of several human viruses including HTLV, Adenovirus and Papillomavirus. Projects in the lab seek to determine why the APC/C seems to be a general target of such a diverse range of viruses and how inhibition of this complex can lead to specific destruction of cancer cells.

Indigenous-State Relations in Alaska and Beyond: Sustainable Livelihoods, Biocultural Diversity and Health since the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (Principal Investigator, National Science Foundation, $485,000, 2008-2011) In September 2007, the National Science Foundation, Arctic Social Science Program funded this three-year project under grant #OPP-0715461. The objective of the project is to analyze how the creation of Alaska Native business corporations (spawned by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971) transformed institutional arrangements between Alaska Natives, state governments, ecosystems, and regional-global economies, and how these Native corporations have contributed to particular outcomes in indigenous groups' biocultural health as measured by indigenous and cross-cultural models of sustainable livelihoods and ecosystem services.

These enzymes often require supramolecular organization and complex architecture to function. For example, both the ribosome and some non-ribosomal peptide synthetases use more than 100,000 atoms to make peptide bonds, while the proteases that break these bonds can be very small. Of course, these assemblies require regulation, processivity and fidelity, which contribute to their increased size. Our lab investigates both the manner by which cellular machines achieve these roles, and the mechanisms of their principal functions. To do this, we combine X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and biochemical techniques. Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are large macromolecular machines that also catalyze peptide bond formation. Instead of making proteins, these enzymes produce a large variety of small molecules with important and diverse biological activity. For example, NRPSs synthesize anti-fungals, anti-bacterials, anti-virals, anti-tumourigenics, siderophores, and immunosuppressants including well-known compounds such as penicillin and cyclosporin. NRPSs use assembly line logic, with dedicated active sites for each amino acid added to the peptide. Single subunit NRPSs can be over 2 megadaltons, and are nature\u2019s largest known enzymes. The ribosome is the cell\u2019s protein factory. It translates the genetic information in mRNA into protein, rapidly and with high fidelity, using aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates. A large number of accessory protein factors are necessary for in vivo protein synthesis, and the interplay between these factors and the ribosome is extremely complex. Deregulation of protein synthesis in humans in associated with cancers, and many important antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome.

The human immune system is generally divided into two broad categories, the adaptive immune system and the innate immune system. Adaptive immunity relies on a very large repertoire of clonally distributed antigen receptors displayed on lymphocytes and secreted antibodies that have the ability to recognize almost any foreign molecule. Conversely, innate immunity depends on a limited set of germ-line encoded receptors, which recognize distinct molecular patterns on pathogen surfaces. These receptors are strategically expressed on cells that are likely to encounter antigen early in an infection, including cells of the respiratory tract, epithelial cells of the gut and skin, and professional antigen presenting cells. As a result, the innate immune response generally precedes the adaptive immune response. Specifically, our lab studies components of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal tranduction pathway, including the TLR receptors themselves and members of the Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) family using X-ray crystallography and other biophysical techniques. Using structural analysis, we would like to dissect the molecular basis for specificity of TLR-ligand interactions and the mechanisms by which the IRAKs are regulated. It is hoped that by visualizing the atomic-level details of these proteins and the interactions they make, we can contribute to potential therapies against infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.", "tag": "aspirant"},

While first discovered in C. elegans, now a recognized group of related phenomena broadly conserved in eukaryotes is generally known as RNA-mediated interference, or RNAi. Central actors to these phenomena are small ~18-25nt non-coding RNAs which are matured by the RNase type III Dicer, and assembled with the Argonaute proteins into a variety of effector silencing complexes. RNAi was first recognized for its potential as a research tool and for the therapeutic promises it holds. It is now widely used in all fields of biomedical research. Soon after its discovery it became clear that the RNAi-related phenomena serve a profound physiological purpose. In one such mechanism termed microRNA-mediated silencing, small RNAs are derived from gene-encoded hairpins and negatively regulate gene expression by base-pairing and silencing messenger RNA by post-transcriptional means. According to predictions, they exert a direct negative regulation pressure on more than 30% of the entire coding gene set. In agreement with such spectacular estimates, microRNA targets have been implicated in the broadest range of cellular functions in developmental, and steady-state contexts. Consistently, some of the small RNA expression events were recently shown to be functionally important for transformation and tumor growth. More recently, yet novel RNAi-related phenomena have emerged. While RNAi was originally thought to be a sequence-directed innate immunity response, these new forms of RNAi (named here loosely endoRNAi) appear to serve other fundamental functions such as mediating heterochromatin formation or consolidation. Loss of machinery involved in endoRNAi results in a broad genetic instability, loss of chromosomes during mitosis, as well as localized and global gene mis-expression. Data from a variety of model systems support a model whereas small RNAs are derived from chromatin loci, and converge back on genomic regions to mediate changes in levels of chromatin folding by directing histone modifications. While these new functions for RNAi are only emerging, it is clear that they will have deep implications on our understanding of how the genome is organized and protected. They also offer a whole new set of possibilities to explain how cellular processes can be altered during the emergence of cancer. My research program has two aims: 1- Understanding the molecular basis for the gene regulatory functions of endogenous RNAi, and 2- Defining small RNA expression events, which are critical for development, and cancer ontogeny.

His doctorate was on Africa-wide rainfall variability and change, which was undertaken jointly between the University of Oxford under Professor Alayne Street-Perrott and Professor Chris Folland's group at the Hadley Centre of the UK Meteorological Office. During this time he was a lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford. He took up a Departmental Lectureship at Oxford in 1995, a University Lectureship position and Fellowship at Keble College in 1999, a Readership in 2006 and was made Professor of Climate Science in 2010. Richard's research is concerned with the African climate systems, including climate change, the mechanisms leading to floods and drought and the way these characteristics of climate are represented in climate models. He has also worked extensively on aerosols, particularly so on dust storms in the central Sahara and in southern Africa. He has run major observational campaigns involving both ground observations and instrumented aircraft in North and southern Africa. He is primarily funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Richard was Co-Chair World Climate Research Program African Climate Variability Panel (CLIVAR-VACS) 2006-2010 and served as a panel member of from 2003-2006. Richard leads the development of the CLIVAR Africa Climate Atlas. He has served as the World Climate Research Program representative to the International Council for Science southern Africa as well as membership of several external steering committees including AFRICANNESS (African Earth System Science) and the Stockholm Environment Institute-Oxford. He was one of 12 members of the NERC Climate Science Strategy Panel for the 2007-2012 NERC Science Strategy. He has taught on several World Climate Program \"Climate Information and Prediction Services (CLIPS)\" Workshops, including Nairobi, Niamey, Dar Es Salaam, Qatar and Tunis. He has served on the panel of judges for the Best Research Paper (SA Society for Atmospheric Scientists) from 2003-2009 and on the management board of several large climate programmes, including AMMAII, and the Climate Science Research Partnership between the Met Office and DFID. He has been an IPCC author in numerous assessment reports including Working Group 1 (Observations of climate change) and Working Group II (Africa). and is Director of the Radcliffe Meteorology Station, the longest known continuous daily meteorological record with daily observations in Oxford since 1815. , and the Co-Investigator of BoDEx (Bodele Dust Experiment). He is currently the Oxford Principal Investigator on the Future Climate for Africa UMFULA (Uncertainty Reduction in Models for Understanding Development Applications) and IMPALA (Improving Model Processes for African Climate) projects. FCFA is a c\u00a320m programme. Richard is also a Co-Investigator of the CLARIFY (Clouds and Aerosol Radiative Impacts and Forcing Year 2016) project and the water security project 'Reach'. There are two primary themes to this research, all of which has an African focus, namely African climate change and dust storms. Dust impacts the climate system through its interaction with radiation, clouds, weather systems and nutrient cycling. Quantifying these interactions is an ongoing concern of dust research generally. The main projects around which Richard's work has been based are BoDEx, Fennec, DO4Models and CLARIFY-2016. A key concern of Richard's research is diagnosing the controls on mineral aerosol (dust) emission and transport from the key global sources. A feature of these programmes is major field observational campaigns to remote areas where the dust sources are located. This work has included field experiments in the world's largest source of mineral aerosols, the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression Chad . He was one of the co-authors to be awarded the Environmental Research Letters Outstanding Article Award in 2007 for a paper on Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 dust and the Amazon basin. An important outcome of BoDEx included the identification of the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Low Level Jet, a strong wind which is crucial to the emission of dust from the basin (see Washington and Todd, 2005, Geophysical Research Letters and Washington et al 2006; Journal of Geophysical Research). More recently the work on dust has been built around the Fennec and DO4Models programmes which Richard leads. Fennec is the first major programme to recover meteorological observations from the data void of the central Sahara. Over the years 2011 and 2012 Fennec led to the deployment of about 30 tons of ground-based instruments and equipment in the central Sahara, including a large collection of observations on the border of Mali and Algeria at Bordj Badi Mokhtar and at Zouerat in Mauritania. The project also involved >200 hours of flying, many at low level, over the central Sahara in the NERC/Met Office instrumented Bae-146 aircraft. Together the ground-based instruments and aircraft flights provided the first insights into the dynamics of dust, low level jets, cold-pool outflows from deep thunderstorms and the Saharan heat low. The weather and climate of the Sahara, in turn, forms a vital part of the West African Monsoon. The Fennec programme is summarised in this short film on The DO4Models project which has been based on Sua Pan in Botswana, the dry river valleys and Etosha Pan in Namibia covering the period 2011-2015. The main aim of DO4Models was to gain observations of dust in the field in dust source areas with which to confront climate models which generally have poor specification of point source dust emission. The CLARIFY project will take the work in Namibia forward over the next few years. Through the recently funded projects IMPALA, UMFULA and Reach, Richard also has a research focus on African climate change, in particular evaluating how mechanisms of rainfall are represented in global and regional climate models and how these mechanisms work in the real world. This interest has extended to the preparation of climate variability and change assessments and future scenarios of African and tropical climate for a variety of government agencies and NGOs. He is the external examiner for the Climate Change MSc at the University of East Anglia and the undergraduate physical geography course and UCD, Ireland. He lectures on 'Observed Climate Change, Climate Models and Climate Change Detection, Attribution and Prediction' as part of the 'Earth Systems Dynamics' second year course. He convenes the Climate Change and Variability optional course which covers the General Circulation, Modes of Climate Variability, Seasonal Prediction, aerosols, African climate and Climate Models. Professor Washington teaches on two MSc programmes - MSc in Water Science, Policy and Management and MSc in Environmental Change and Management. He teaches the tropical climate system as part of the NERC Doctoral Training Programme in Oxford.", "tag": "aspirant"},

However, all programs share a common theme in that they use structural biological approaches to examine interactions between enzymes and small molecules (e.g. substrates, cofactors, inhibitors). The principal technique used for these studies is X-ray crystallography, complemented with small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, enzymology and computational chemistry tools. Furthermore, for many of these programs, efforts are ongoing to exploit the three-dimensional structural information for drug development using structure-based drug design approaches. Below two programs are highlighted. Over the past few decades there has been a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, and the situation has now culminated in bacteria that are effectively resistant to all clinically used antibiotics. The research is aimed at dissecting the structural basis for clinical resistance against various antibiotics. Specifically resistance mechanisms for ribosome targeting antibiotics are examined. Many of these antibiotics have lost their potency due to bacterial enzymes that either covalently modify or cleave the drugs. For example, we have determined the detailed mechanism by which aminoglycoside kinases confer resistance to drugs such as gentamicin and kanamycin, and we are currently exploiting this knowledge towards the development of next-generation antibiotics and adjuvants. Fungal infections are a rising concern in the health care sector since pathogenic fungi have become an important cause of mortality for individuals with diminished immune systems. The concern for fungal infections is amplified by the fact that there are a very limited number of antimycotic drugs available and resistance against most commonly used antifungal agents has been observed. To assist in the drug discovery process for novel antimycotic agents, we are pursuing structural studies of fungal enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of essential metabolites that are specific to fungi. These synthetic pathways are absent in mammals, and as such pose an excellent target for the development of antimicrobial drugs. For example, we have determined the structure of the fungal enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase in complex with a drug lead that is able to clear systemic candidiasis in a mouse model.

Much of his research has been carried out in Africa, but he also conducts research in Arabia, Asia, India, North America and other dryland contexts. His research has often been multi- and interdisciplinary. On the one hand he has led interdisciplinary projects on desertification, land degradation, sustainable land use and climate change impacts; on the other he works on projects focussed on geomorphological processes, Late Quaternary environmental change, climate change science and environmental-climate interactions, with archaeologists, biologists, climate scientists and other physical geographers. He has authored or edited 10 books, including (1991) and over 200 peer-reviewed journal papers and contributions to edited volumes including IPCC assessment reports. In 2011 David was awarded the Geological Society of America Farouk El-Baz Award, for a body of work that has significantly enhanced desert science. In 2004 David Thomas was elected Professor of Geography at Oxford, holding the original statutory chair previously occupied by Andrew Goudie, Jean Gottmann, E.W.Gilbert and Kenneth Mason. He is also Professorial Fellow at Hertford College, and was Head of the School of Geography and Environment from 2007- 2011. Prior to returning to Oxford, where he was a student from 1977-84 for undergraduate, Cert. Ed. and D.Phil degrees, David was at Sheffield University, rising from lecturer to Professor in the Department of Geography between 1984 and 1994, founding the Sheffield Centre for International Drylands research in 1994 (Director until 2004) and serving as Head of Department form 1997-2000. In 2006 he was appointed Honorary Professor at the University of Cape Town and in 2013 at the University of the Witwatersrand, both in South Africa. In recent years he has been Vice-President of the Royal Geographical Society (for Research and Higher Education, 2013-16, and Fieldwork and Expeditions, 2002-5). In 2002-2005 he was chair of the British Geomorphological Research Group; when the group was re-established as the British Society for Geomorphology he was elected as one of the founding Fellows, in 2014. From 2014-16 he chaired the RGS International Benchmark Review of UK Physical Geography, and in 2013-14 chaired the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) which increased the expectation for quantitative analysis and fieldwork in geography degree courses. He was a member of the REF2008 and RAE2014 Geography subpanels and has been a member of similar discipline and university sector reviews overseas. From 2011-14 he was a member of the UK Government Office for Science, Foresight Programme Lead Expert Group, 'Environmental drivers of migration' ( Despite undertaking many internal university and external administrative and executive roles, as well as leading major research projects, David Thomas maintains a significant teaching and doctoral supervision profile and is a member of the management committee of Oxford's NERC-DTP. To date he has supervised over 35 doctoral students to completion, including many now in their own, often senior, academic posts. These include Professors Andy Dougill (Dean of the Faculty of Environment, Leeds University), David Nash (Brighton), Joanna Bullard (Loughborough) and Lindsay Stringer (Leeds), and Drs Jeremy Perkins (Botswana), Chasca Twyman (Sheffield), Andy Carr (Leicester), Brain Chase (CNRS Montpellier), Matt Telfer (Plymouth), Tom Stevens (Uppsala), Alex Arnell (Reading), Susannah Sallu (Leeds), Sallie Burrough (Oxford) and Abi Stone (Manchester). David Thomas has been PI or Co-I on research grants funded by RCUK (NERC and ESRC), The Leverhulme Trust, Fell and Boise Funds totalling almost \u00a39million in value. Most projects employ rigorous fieldwork to generate empirical datasets from environmental contexts that are data-poor. , These data are then analysed with appropriate laboratory (including geochronology) methods; results are often then used in modelling contexts. Many field seasons have been spent working on Quaternary environmental change and aeolian process questions in and around the margins of deserts in Africa and other continents, with over 35 years spent working in the interior of southern Africa, especially in and around the extensive Kalahari region. It is difficult to establish how the world's extensive deserts and drylands have responded to past global climate changes, data that will inform us about potential responses to future climate changes. Many of the traditional Quaternary terrestrial proxy data sources available in other environments, especially those with biological origins, are not available in these dry systems, so we have extensively used geoproxy data (Thomas, 2013; Thomas and Burrough , 2012), from aeolian (dune) and lacustrine (lake shoreline) sediment sources, producing luminescence age records of sedimentary accumulation histories over timescales of up to 250ka. Long standing work in the Kalahari region (parts of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe) (e.g. Stone and Thomas, 2008, Burrough and Thomas ,2008) has been followed by similar approaches in the Arabia deserts (Leighton In the United Arab Emirates mega dune ridges represent a record of aeolian accumulation that is a result of significant environmental changes in the Late Quaternary. Quarrying of sand for construction presents a unique opportunity to analyse dune interior structures, and to sample for OSL dating in order to develop a record of landscape development in response to climate change. ., 2005) and we are now exploring new modelling approaches to better interpret the timing and drivers of past desert dune accumulation (Bailey and Thomas, 2013). New approaches are also being tested for extracting geochemical records of long term climate and environmental change from the extensive dry lake systems of the Kalahari, since this desert has not only had geographically extensive active dune systems in the past, but has also supported megalakes up to 60,000ka2 in size. (Burrough, Thomas & Bailey, 2009). Sedimentological and geochronometric work in southern Africa is also being extended to Quaternary fluvial valley deposits in Namibia, which offer the potential to understand the nature and timing of fluvial dynamics within the world's driest desert region. We are also exploring ways to use luminescence dating to analyse dryland land surface responses to drought, working in Nebraska, as well as projects looking at improving knowledge on the origins and deposition timing of European loess. Deserts are full of evidence of the presence of early humans and even early civilisations. Environmental and climatic ('hydroclimate') dynamics in the past have made areas that appear inhabitable and inhospitable today more attractive for opportunistic and persistent human presence in the past. This theme is currently being investigated through collaborative research with archaeologists and palaeoscientists in two differing contexts: the landscape archaeology of the Kalahari of Botswana and the ancient Indus civilisation of the Thar Desert, while other research has occurred in the context of 'green Arabia' in the United Arab Emirates (Preston, Thomas David Thomas is currently Principal Investigator on the Leverhulme Trust-funded project 'Landscape archaeology of the Kalahari: How did major hydrological shifts affect Stone Age mobility and landscape use in the late Quaternary?'. The core aim is to provide the first systematic analysis of the neglected Stone Age archaeology of the Middle Kalahari, central southern Africa, and its raw material source areas, in relation to the region's hydrological history. We are innovatively combining geochemical, field archaeological and palaeoenvironmental methods to provide the first analysis of Stone Age responses to the major hydrological changes that the Kalahari has experienced over the last ~100ka.

Lithics in the desert: a find in the Kalahari in 2011 during fieldwork that led to the current project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. In the Thar Desert we are working with archaeologists to provide data on the nature and timing of the landscape dynamics associated with mid-Holocene Indus population changes, as part of wider assessments of both the regions complex history of monsoon dynamics and the postulated collapse of urban civilisations around 4000ka ago (Durcan and Thomas David Thomas was a Co-I on the NERC-funded DO4Models project that investigated drivers of terrestrial desert dust sources into the atmosphere, as part of a wider initiative to improve the incorporation of mineral dust components in global climate models. Engaged with the extensive field monitoring and data collection component of the project in the Makgadikgadi basin, Botswana and the dry valleys of western Namibia, the project has led to additional developments that are investigating the critical role of mineral desert dust in ocean fertilisation (Dansie , Thomas David has along track record of research into modern land degradation in drylands and its interactions with human activities (e.g. Stringer, Twyman and Thomas, 2007) and climate dynamics (Thomas, 2008), including recent work in Africa (King and Thomas, 2014) and Mongolia (e.g. Sternberg, Thomas and Middleton 2010), and that which might related environmental changes to human movements (Arnall, Thomas From 2002-5 he was the principal investigator on a major research project funded by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The project investigated how natural resource-dependant societies in the developing world, particularly southern Africa, respond and and shocks such as drought and floods, and how these responses may better inform an understanding of likely 21st century responses to global warming-induced climate change (Thomas ., 2009). This was a truly interdisciplinary project that brought together social and environmental scientists including climate and vegetation modellers. Key outcomes included work on learning processes in adaptation, changing use of ecosystem resources, and equity and justice issues (Thomas and Twyman, 2005). A Individual research projects also feed into wider initiatives, where data are shared and analysed and where ideas and collaborations grow. David Thomas is involved with as number of international research collaborations, this also previously included leading series of successful IGCP projects. Current activities include being a key member of: project that has developed an open source global digital database of chronological records of sand dune accumulation and stabilisation. Over 6000 luminescence ages have been produced from desert dune systems worldwide, creating data with the potential to explore desert responses to climate change across the globe (Lancaster, Wolfe, Thomas, The Leverhulme Trust's SPAN the Atlantic programme, which initiates collaborations and shares research approaches between archaeologists and environmental scientists working in South American and southern Africa.

After obtaining his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Biology in 1988, he spent a brief time working at Amgen before becoming an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1989. He moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in September of 1999, where he is now the C.P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering and Biological Engineering, in addition to working with the Koch Institute as the Associate Director for Engineering. Engineers now have the tools to design biological products and processes at the molecular level. Proteins are of particular therapeutic interest, because proteins mediate most biochemical processes both inside and outside cells. The ability to manipulate the strength and specificity of protein binding events provides tremendous leverage for the development of novel biopharmaceuticals. The Wittrup laboratory is developing powerful new tools for protein engineering, and applying them both to particular disease targets and to bettering our understanding of protein structure/function relationships. In the absence of predictive capabilities for protein design, a directed evolution or combinatorial library screening strategy can be effectively applied to alter protein properties in a desired fashion. The group is applying quantitative engineering analyses of the relevant kinetic and statistical processes to develop optimal search strategies on the protein fitness landscape. In particular, the lab has developed a method for protein display on the surface of yeast cells that, for example, enabled engineering of a noncovalent protein-ligand bond with a dissociation half-time over one week. The group is engineering potential protein biopharmaceuticals in areas where molecular understanding of disease pathology is sufficient to hypothesize particular objective functions to target. For example, antibodies can be used to target cell-killing modalities to cancerous cells, given sufficiently strong and specific binding properties. Growth factors that carry signals between cells do so via particular binding events that, if manipulated to alter intracellular trafficking or signalling outcomes, could alter immune responses in precisely defined ways. Finally, viral and nonviral vectors for gene therapy could be targeted to specific cells and tissues via alteration of an exchangeable antibody recognition module. Altered proteins developed in this work can also provide a potential vehicle for new insights into the mechanisms of protein-ligand binding. The lab is performing biophysical analyses of the kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural aspects of engineered protein function in order to contribute to an improved understanding of protein binding processes.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Elucidation of signal transduction cascades involved in oncogenesis, cancer progression, and metastasis will generate both novel drug targets and a host of biological markers, allowing for early diagnosis and tracking of cancer progression. A variety of other applications will be pursued, including mapping the phosphorylation events associated with development of Type I and Type II diabetes.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Cells sense their environment, process information, and continuously react to both internal and external stimuli. The construction of synthetic gene networks can help improve our understanding of such naturally existing regulatory functions within cells. Synthetic gene networks will also enable a wide range of new programmed cells applications. The Weiss lab uses computer engineering principles of abstraction, composition, and interface specifications to program cells with sensors and actuators precisely controlled by analog and digital logic circuitry. Here, recombinant DNA-binding proteins represent signals, and recombinant genes perform the computation by regulating protein expression. The group constructed synthetic gene networks that implement biochemical logic circuits in Escherichia coli fabricated using the AND, NOT, and IMPLIES logic gates. The lab has built a variety of circuits, including a transcriptional cascade whose digital behavior improves significantly with the addition of genetic components. The group has also built analog circuits that perform signal processing to detect specific chemical gradients and generate pulses in response to cell-cell communication. The integration of digital and analog circuitry is useful for controlling the behavior of individual cells and the lab has also combined these circuits with engineered cell-cell communication to coordinate the behavior of cell aggregates.", "tag": "aspirant"},

He continued his postdoctoral research in Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. His academic career commenced as an Assistant and Associate Professor at the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California-San Francisco. Chris Voigt joined the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT as Associate Professor in 2011. Genetic engineering is undergoing a revolution, where next-generation technologies for DNA and host manipulation are enabling larger and more ambitious projects in biotechnology. Automated DNA synthesis has advanced to where it is routine to order sequences >100,000bp where every base is user-specified, the turnaround time is several weeks, and the cost is rapidly declining. Recently, this facilitated the synthesis of a complete 1 Mbp genome of a bacterium and its transfer into a new host, resulting in a living cell. However, while whole genomes can be constructed, the ability to design such systems is lagging. The focus of my lab is to develop new experimental and theoretical methods to push the scale of genetic engineering, with the ultimate objective of genome design. This will impact the engineering of biology for a broad range of applications, including agriculture, materials, chemicals, and medicine. My lab is roughly divided into two groups. The first is focused on the development of a programming language for cells. A genetic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153program\u00e2\u20ac\u009d consists of a combination of genetic circuits, each of which uses biochemistry to replicate a function analogous to an electronic circuit (e.g., a logic gate). Combining circuits yields more complex signal processing operations. For example, we combined 4 circuits to build an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153edge detection program\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in E. coli that enables cells to draw the light-dark boundaries of an image projected on a plate. Our near-term objective is to develop the foundations by which 20-30 circuit programs can be reliably built. This will require new classes of circuits that can be rapidly connected and are sufficiently simple and robust to be assembled by computer algorithms. We are also developing biophysical models that can map the sequence of a genetic part (e.g., a ribosome binding site) to its function. These models can be used to connect and optimize circuits and programs. The second group in my lab is focused on applying these tools to problems in biotechnology. This encompasses new approaches to old problems (e.g., nitrogen fixation) as well as more futuristic ideas (e.g., re-programming bacteria as a drug delivery device). Currently, we are focused on harnessing the functions encoded within prokaryotic gene clusters. These are contiguous stretches of DNA in the genome that (ideally) contain all of the genes necessary and sufficient for that function. These clusters consist of diverse functions requiring ~20+ genes, including elaborate nano-machines and metabolic pathways. We are applying principles from synthetic biology to rebuild these functions from the ground up, in order to eliminate complex and often uncharacterized native regulation, gain complete control and understanding of the cluster, and to facilitate its optimization and transfer between organisms. To do this, we use the same computational tools, genetic circuits, and construction methodologies developed by the foundational half of the lab. This work represents a step towards whole genome design, where our vision is that the future designer would mix-and-match modular clusters to build a synthetic organism.", "tag": "aspirant"},

At MIT, Van Vliet was a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellow, was President of the Graduate Materials Council, and won the MRS Gold Medal for her thesis research. Her MIT thesis work with Prof. Subra Suresh established the experimental and computational basis for predicting homogeneous nucleation of dislocations (plasticity carrying defects) in crystalline metals. She then conducted postdoctoral research with Dr. Marsha Moses at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, where she developed new experimental approaches to measure the effects of mechanical strain on cells that comprise blood vessels. The Laboratory for Material Chemomechanics is focused on understanding the coupling between chemistry and mechanics at material interfaces. The overarching motivation for this study of chemomechanics is the biological cell. There is increasing experimental evidence that changes in the local mechanical environment (e.g., material stiffness or applied force) and chemical environment (e.g., pH or biomolecule concentrations) of cells correlate with changes in cell shape and function. Although the individual proteins at this interface are now well studied, the mechanisms by which mechanical and chemical signals are exchanged across this interface to impact cell functions are not fully understood. The aim is to elucidate this chemomechanical coupling at the molecular scale, leveraging the perspectives and tools of materials physics. The group focuses on cell interfaces and environments relevant to wound healing and inflammation, cancer, and stem/precursor cell development. To aid the development of new tools and models of such complex interfaces, they also study engineered nanocomposites and nanostructures that share this strong chemomechanical coupling. The Van Vliet group investigates material chemomechanics through both experiments and simulations, which are integrated among three main efforts. First, the group analyzes chemomechanics at the cell-material interface. The group seeks to understand the mechanisms by which the mechanical and biochemical properties of extracellular microenvironments modulate cell adhesion and biological processes. For example, the effects of substrata elastic moduli on adhesion of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Another major research thrust of the lab is studying the chemomechanics of complex gels. Both the interior and exterior of biological cells comprise materials described as crowded gels and polymer networks, often existing in metastable states that are perturbed via external cues. The group explores chemomechanics in synthetic gels that either (1) interface with biological cells, and thus serve as a tool to modulate cell environments; or (2) are not intended as biomaterials, but serve as excellent physical models of such complex biopolymers. The final research area of the Van Vliet group is researching the chemomechanics of defected crystals and nanocomposite interfaces. The interfaces within subcellular structures \u2013 and also between cells & adjacent materials \u2013 are dynamic. Both biologists and material scientists have referred to these interfacial regions as interphases, characterized by unique nanostructue and viscoelastic behavior. The Laboratory for Material Chemochanics develops new computational models and experiments to characterize the chemomechanical evolution of such nanoscale interphases in engineered materials.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Research in the Tidor Group is focused on the analysis of complex biological systems at the molecular and network levels. Projects at the molecular level study the structure and properties of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. Investigations probe the sources of stability and specificity that drive macromolecular folding, binding, and catalysis. Studies are aimed at dissecting the interactions responsible for the specific structure of folded proteins and the binding geometry of molecular complexes. The roles played by salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, side-chain packing, rotameric states, solvation, and the hydrophobic effect in native biomolecules are being explored, and strategies for re-casting these roles through structure-based molecular design are being developed. Work at the network level involves the study of biochemical regulatory networks and signal transduction pathways in cells. The development of approaches to relate network topology to functional characteristics is fundamental to this research. Significant effort is being applied to extracting the design principles for biological networks and to understanding the control functions implemented. The insights resulting from this work will provide a strong foundation for understanding biological systems; moreover, they will be useful for the development of therapies that ameliorate disease states, as well as for the construction of new synthetic systems from biological components.

Subsequently, Tannenbaum earned a PhD in Food Science and Technology with a Minor in Chemistry also from MIT. He then joined the MIT faculty in the Department of Nutrition and Food Science which evolved into the Department of Biological Engineering. For many years, the Tannenbaum lab has been interested in the formation, distribution, and metabolism of nitrate, nitrite, and N-nitroso compounds. This work led to their discovery of the endogenous synthesis of nitrogen oxides and eventually the discovery of nitric oxide as a biological molecule. At present the laboratory is conducting research on the pathophysiological consequences of nitric oxide and its oxidation products. This encompasses cell-mediated nitrosation, free-radical reactions, and oxidation. Of particular interest is the nature of chemical damage to DNA and its genotoxic consequences. From a health point of view this is important for the inflammatory state and for various infections and diseases that increase the risk of cancer. The Tannenbaum group is also interested in the inhibition of these reactions by antioxidants and other substances that offer protection from oxidative stress. Another great interest of the Tannenbaum lab is tissue engineering for drug development and chemical toxicity. Cells placed in culture generally lose at least some key differentiated physiological functions that they normally exhibit as part of organized tissues in the body. Thus, while cultured cells may be adequate for some applications in drug metabolism and detection of toxins, they are certain to fail for others. The Tannenbaum Lab has developed an in vitro organized tissue-based sensor for detection of unknown toxins and rapid screening of drug metabolism. The technology combines a unique chip-based micro tissue arrangement with mass spectrometric and optical sensors to detect changes in tissue behavior and measure primary and secondary biochemical transformations of drugs and toxins. The Tannenbaum Lab is also developing new approaches to measure the fate of drugs and chemicals in the classical paradigm for drug metabolism: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME). The methods include variations in biological Mass Spectrometry and Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy. The Tannenbaum laboratory has previously conducted extensive research on the chemistry and structural analysis of biological polymers, including proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides. State-of-the-art mass spectrometry instrumentation has enabled them to make quantitative measurements at the sub-femtomole level.

He continued his postdoctoral research at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Peter So joined MIT as Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1996. Since 2000 he has also served as Associate Director of the Whitehead-MIT Bioimaging center. Many advances in biology and medicine are driven by the availability of new diagnostic tools. Our research focuses on the engineering of novel microscopy instrumentation and the application of these new tools to study biomedical problems. The problems tackled in my laboratory range from understanding the structure/function of single proteins, nature's smallest machines, to the devolpment of a new non-invasive optical method for cancer diagnosis. The available research topics in my laboratory can be categorized into molecular, cellular and tissue levels: Standing-Wave Total Internal Reflection Microscopy (SW-TIRM): Conventional optical microscopy has a resolution about 300 nm, limited by the diffraction of light. We are developing SW-TIRM that may fundamentally overcome the resolution barrier of optical microscopy and achieve resolution below 50 nm. This technique offers the potential to study the dynamics and function of cells and proteins with resolution approaching that of electron microscopes (In collaboration with Dr. E. Shyamsunder, Boston University). Single Molecule Dynamics: We are developing microscopic spectroscopy, imaging, and manipulation technologies to study proteins and biopolymers, such as DNA, on a single molecular level. Single molecule studies provide an understanding of how domain conformation changes regulate protein activities and functions. With our collaborators, we are studying the effect of DNA torsional forces on drug and protein binding and are studying the dynamics of l-exonuclease as it digests DNA. (In collaboration with Dr. P. Dedon, MIT and Dr. E. Gratton, UIUC). Cellular Mechanics and Mechanotransduction: In many of biological systems, such as bones, cartilages, and the vascular system, mechanical forces play important roles in regulating biological activities. We are developing micromanipulation techniques, optical and magnetic, to exert precise force on the cellular cytoskeleton. Further, we are developing imaging and spectroscopic methods to quantify cellular strains in 3-D, to monitor mechano-sensitive signaling events, and to study mechanical effects on gene expression. (In collaboration with Dr. R. Lee and Dr. R. Kamm, MIT) Intracellular Transport and Trafficking: A variety of intracellular transport and trafficking processes, such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and bacterial/viral invasion, are of fundamental biological importance. We are developing two new methods to quantify these processes. The first technique is two-photon single particle tracking. This technique allows the trajectory of a single particle to be monitored with nanometer spatial resolution and millisecond time resolution inside living cells. The second technique is two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy that allows the quantification of the number density, the diffusion rate, and the flow rate of particles being transported inside cells. Functional Deep Tissue Imaging: There is a lack of non-invasive diagnostic techniques for imaging thick tissue biochemistry and morphology at sub-cellular resolution. Two-photon imaging allows the mapping of fluorophore distribution inside tissue down to a depth of over 500 mm providing sub-cellular level tissue morphological information. Spectroscopic measurement of endogenous fluorescence further allows us to quantify tissue biochemical and metabolic states. Spectroscopic instruments are developed to quantify the spectra and the lifetime of tissue fluorophores. (In collaboration with Dr. C. Dong, National Taiwan University, Dr. C. Buehler, Paul Scherrer Institut, and Dr. T. Hacewicz, Unilever Edgewater Laboratory). Two-Photon 3-D Image Cytometry: We are developing 3-D image cytometer based on a video-rate two-photon scanning microscopy. The high speed of this microscope allows the sampling of a large cell population and measures cellular properties high statistical precision. The use of a two-photon microscope further allows properties of individual cells to be assessed inside tissues in vivo. Two-photon 3-D cytometer has the potential for the detection of rare cellular events inside living animals. A promising application of this 3-D image cytometer is for the study of mitotic recombination events in tissues. (In collaboration with Dr. B. Engleward, MIT). Two-Photon Endoscopy: Based on two-photon deep tissue imaging technology, we are developing a miniaturized system for clinical diagnosis. We aim to distinguish healthy and pathological tissues based on their microscopic morphology and the variations in their endogenous fluorescence spectra. The development of this endoscopic instrument may enable non-invasive cancer diagnosis in dermal, gynecological, and gastrointestinal systems. (In collaboration with Dr. P. Kaplan, Unilever Edgewater Laboratory and Dr. S. Acker, Wisconsin Medical Center).", "tag": "aspirant"},

Upon graduation with a Bachelor of Science degree, she moved on to complete her PhD in Molecular Biology at the University College London. Subsequently, she performed postdoctoral research at the University California, San Francisco and the University of California, Berkley. Before joining MIT, Samson was a Professor of Toxicology and Cancer Cell Biology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Samson has also previously served as the Director of the MIT Center for Environmental Health Sciences. Alkylating agents represent an abundant class of chemical DNA damaging agent in our environment. They are toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic. Since we are continuously exposed to alkylating agents, and since certain alkylating agents are used for cancer chemotherapy, it is important to understand exactly how cells respond when exposed to these agents. The repair of DNA alkylation damage provides tremendous protection against the toxic effects of these agents and the Samson group\u2019s aim is to understand the biology, the biochemistry, and the genetics of numerous DNA repair pathways that act upon DNA alkylation damage. Organisms separated by enormous evolutionary distances employ similar proteins to protect against DNA damage. Bacteria, yeast, and human cells induce the expression of specific sets of genes in response to such damage. The Samson Lab\u2019s studies on the response of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells to alkylating agents have become intimately intertwined. Much of their previous work was based on the findings that bacterial DNA repair functions can operate in eukaryotic cells, and vice versa, i.e., eukaryotic DNA repair functions can operate in bacterial cells. They exploited this phenomenon to clone a large number of yeast, mouse, and human DNA alkylation repair genes, and are using these cloned genes to gain a thorough understanding of how eukaryotic cells respond to alkylating agents. Moreover, the Samson group has extended the alkylation toxicity studies from the cellular level to the whole animal level. Specifically, they have: (i) produced transgenic and knock-out mice with altered DNA repair capabilities and are now measuring their susceptibility to alkylation toxicity; and (ii) transferred DNA alkylation repair genes to bone marrow cells to determine whether such gene therapy could confer a useful level of extra resistance in the bone marrow of chemotherapy patients. When cells are exposed to DNA damaging agents a signal is generated such that the transcription of various genes is altered. They have used Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA chip analysis to monitor the transcriptional response of the entire S. cerevisiae genome, i.e., all 6,200 genes in response to a number of different alkylating agents. To the Samson group\u2019s surprise, they identified hundreds of responsive genes and have uncovered a hitherto unknown response that links ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and DNA repair. They are currently exploring the biological roles that the large number of responsive genes plays in protecting cells against alkylation toxicity. Signals can also be generated, in cells exposed to alkylating agents, which trigger cell cycle checkpoint arrest or apoptosis. The Samson group is also dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which alkylating agents signal these very important downstream events.", "tag": "aspirant"},

Linear protein molecules must fold into sophisticated three-dimensional structures, and interact with the appropriate cellular targets. In cells, the folding and maturation of proteins depend on a specialized class of proteins termed 'molecular chaperones'. The chaperones are critical for the prevention of protein misfolding and aggregation, which are thought to underlie several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Two of the most important chaperones in the eukaryotic cytosol are Hsp70 and Hsp90, the 70 kDa and 90 kDa heat shock proteins. The function of both chaperones involves interactions with a variety of regulatory co-chaperone proteins whose activities are still poorly understood. My research investigates the biochemical mechanisms of chaperone and co-chaperone activity, and the consequences of this essential activity at a cellular level. Interestingly, Hsp70 and Hsp90 work not only in the folding of soluble proteins, but also help in other cellular processes. These include the targeting of certain precursor proteins to the mitochondria for import into that organelle. Chaperones also work in the regulated assembly or disassembly of protein complexes on other intracellular membranes. It seems that specific co-chaperones are used for the different functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90. Key questions are how the various co-chaperones direct the activities of the chaperones, for folding and for other purposes, and how chaperone function is integrated into the biogenesis of cellular structures. A combination of biochemistry, molecular and cell biology techniques are being applied to these exciting questions.

Detected in its earliest stages, melanoma is highly curable; however, the 5-year survival rate declines drastically for regional and distant metastatic disease. Recently, melanoma has emerged as the latest success story for both genomics- and immune-guided targeted therapy. Cutaneous melanoma is characterized by hotspot mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulators, BRAF and NRAS, found in approximately 50% and 25% of patients, respectively. The identification of these oncogenic mutations has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting MAPK kinase kinases (MEK) and BRAF in melanoma. Although antitumor responses to MAPK targeted therapies have been dramatic; they are rarely durable. Furthermore, novel therapies targeting inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins have recently shown impressive clinical efficacy; nevertheless, biomarkers that predict response remain unclear. For the past four years, I have led a number of multi-institutional collaborations (Hodis, Watson et al., 2012 Cell), which include The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA, 2015 Cell), to characterize the melanoma genome and perform integrative analysis with multiple data platforms at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Our work has identified a number of novel significantly mutated genes in melanomas, which possess hotspot mutations in coding and non-coding regions. Based on the frequency and correlation of the most frequently significantly mutated genes, we established a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes: mutant BRAF, RAS, NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type) melanomas. To improve on the current diagnostic and treatment modalities employed in the clinic, my lab will address the following questions: What is the biological function and therapeutic relevance of novel significantly mutated genes discovered in our melanoma genome- and exome-sequencing studies? To tackle these problems, my lab will employ computational approaches, in vivo models and biochemical techniques studying patient samples, cell lines, and melanoma mouse models.

Our research interest has focused on three recently cloned enzymes and their relationship to mouse development and cancer. One of these PTPases, termed MPTP, is a ubiquitously expressed PTPase which localizes to the cell nucleus and may play a role in cell cycle events.

These include: cloning and identification of tissue specific and developmentally regulated PTPases; identification of substrates, associated proteins, and extracellular ligands; creation of temperature sensitive enzymes and cell lines; and the analysis of the gene expression pattern during mouse development. Together with transgenic and \"knockout\" mouse technology, these tools allow us to asses the role of these genes during mouse development as well as cellular events involved in cancer.", "tag": "aspirant"},

High-fidelity patient simulators (PSs)-the predominant method for training healthcare teams-are expensive to develop and implement and require that trainees be present in the same place at the same time. In contrast, online computer-based simulators are more cost effective and allow simultaneous participation by students in different locations and time zones. In this pilot study, the researchers created an online virtual emergency department (Virtual ED) for team training in crisis management, and compared the effectiveness of the Virtual ED with the PS. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in learning outcomes for graduating medical students trained with each method.In this pilot study, we used a pretest-posttest control group, experimental design in which 30 subjects were randomly assigned to either the Virtual ED or the PS system. In the Virtual ED each subject logged into the online environment and took the role of a team member. Four-person teams worked together in the Virtual ED, communicating in real time with live voice over Internet protocol, to manage computer-controlled patients who exhibited signs and symptoms of physical trauma. Each subject had the opportunity to be the team leader. The subjects' leadership behavior as demonstrated in both a pretest case and a posttest case was assessed by 3 raters, using a behaviorally anchored scale. In the PS environment, 4-person teams followed the same research protocol, using the same clinical scenarios in a Simulation Center. Guided by the Emergency Medicine Crisis Resource Management curriculum, both the Virtual ED and the PS groups applied the basic principles of team leadership and trauma management (Advanced Trauma Life Support) to manage 6 trauma cases-a pretest case, 4 training cases, and a posttest case. The subjects in each group were assessed individually with the same simulation method that they used for the training cases.Subjects who used either the Virtual ED or the PS showed significant improvement in performance between pretest and posttest cases (P < 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in subjects' performance between the 2 types of simulation, suggesting that the online Virtual ED may be as effective for learning team skills as the PS, the method widely used in Simulation Centers. Data on usability and attitudes toward both simulation methods as learning tools were equally positive.This study shows the potential value of using virtual learning environments for developing medical students' and resident physicians' team leadership and crisis management skills. Youngblood, P., Hedman, L., Creutzfeld, J., Fellander-Tsai, L., Stengard, K., Hansen, K., Dev, P., Srivastava, S., Kusumoto, L., Hendrick, A., Heinrichs, W. L. In this study we created a virtual 3D world for learning to manage medical emergencies and evaluated it with 24 high school students in the USA and Sweden. We found that students in both groups felt immersed and found the online simulation easy to use. Scores for flow and self-assessed flow were significantly higher for the RHS group as compared to the HG group (p=.001 and .023 respectively; Mann Whitney U test). Self-efficacy scores for the HG group were significantly higher after training (p=.016 Mann Whitney U test). Males in the RHS group scored significantly higher on flow and self assessed flow than females (p=.006 and p=.023 respectively; Mann Whitney U test). This study demonstrates the potential value of using MMOS for learning to respond to medical emergencies. We have investigated collaborative learning of anatomy over Internet2, using an application called remote stereo viewer (RSV). This application offers a unique method of teaching anatomy, using high-resolution stereoscopic images, in a client-server architecture. Rotated sequences of stereo image pairs were produced by volumetric rendering of the Visible female and by dissecting and photographing a cadaveric hand. A client-server application (RSV) was created to provide access to these image sets, using a highly interactive interface. The RSV system was used to provide a \"virtual anatomy\" session for students in the Stanford Medical School Gross Anatomy course. The RSV application allows both independent and collaborative modes of viewing. The most appealing aspects of the RSV application were the capacity for stereoscopic viewing and the potential to access the content remotely within a flexible temporal framework. The RSV technology, used over Internet2, thus serves as an effective complement to traditional methods of teaching gross anatomy. This study evaluates the relative roles of the radial collateral ligament, the lateral ulnar collateral ligament, and the overlying musculature in posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow. Fourteen cadaveric upper limbs underwent sequential arthroscopic sectioning of the lateral collateral ligament complex. After sectioning, arthroscopic and fluoroscopic evaluation of a lateral pivot shift test was done. Minimal instability was noted after the first section, but no difference between radial collateral or lateral ulnar collateral ligament sectioning was found. A greater degree of instability was seen between the first and second cut ( P = .0001), but no significant difference was seen between sectioning the 2 groups ( P = .61). Complete instability occurred only after sectioning the overlying musculature. On the basis of this study, injury to both the radial collateral and lateral ulnar collateral ligaments is necessary to cause significant posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow. Furthermore, the overlying musculature plays an important role in overall stability. Several studies have investigated the transfer of surgical trainees' skills acquired on surgical simulators to the operating room setting. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two laparoscopic surgery simulators by assessing the transfer of skills learned on simulators to closely matched surgical tasks in the animal laboratory.In this post-test-only Control group study design, 46 surgically naive medical student volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Tower Trainer group (n = 16), LapSim group (n = 17), and Control group (n = 13). Outcomes measures included both time and accuracy scores on three laparoscopic tasks (Task 1: Grasp and Place; Task 2: Run the Bowel; Task 3: Clip and Cut) performed on live anesthetized pigs, and a global rating of overall performance as judged by four experienced surgeons.The Tower Trainer group performed significantly better than the Control group on 1 of 7 outcomes measures-Task 3: Time (p < 0.032), although the LapSim group performed significantly better than the Control group on 2 of 7 measures-Task 3: Time (p < 0.008) and Global score (p < 0.005). In comparing the two simulators, the LapSim group performed significantly better than the Tower Trainer group on 3 of 7 outcomes measures-Task 2: Time (p < 0.032), Task 2: Accuracy (p < 0.030) and Global score (p < 0.005), although the Tower Trainer group did not perform significantly better than the LapSim group on any measure.This study demonstrated that naive subjects trained on a virtual-reality part-task trainer performed better on live surgical tasks in a porcine model as compared with those trained with a traditional box trainer. These findings could aid in selection of appropriate training methodologies. A structured vocabulary is proposed for supporting the design and development of advanced surgical simulators. Nine fundamental surgical instrument-tissue actions or manipulations are defined and common synonyms provided. The vocabulary focuses on \"target skills\" that are familiar to surgeons, in comparison with \"enabling skills\" from the lexicon of instructional designers and psychometricians. The adoption of this vocabulary can facilitate communication among surgeons and bioengineers developing \"high-fidelity\" surgical simulators. Development of 3-D models of human anatomy for use in virtual reality simulators is anticipated to enhance surgical training. These models may be a valuable resource for gaining mastery of minimal-access procedures. The pelvis portion (hip to upper-thigh) of a 32-year-old female cadaver was frozen and sectioned axially in approximately 2-mm increments as the first step in producing an accurately representative 3-D model of the human female pelvis. Photographic exposures of the entire series of 95 sections were then converted to digital format. Adobe PhotoShop masks for each structure were created and converted into wire-frame and surface-textured models; this aggregate model set was named \"LUCY.\" To date, 3-D representations of 40 pelvic structures (over 2200 individual masks) have been modeled In conjunction with haptic technology, these virtual anatomic models will enable users to practice fundamental surgical manipulations and procedures such as tubal ligation and ovariectomy. The deployment of surgical-simulation models such as LUCY may facilitate technical-performance aspects of surgical training, particularly those associated with minimal-access procedures. Manipulations and procedures can be practiced over the Internet, providing a host of flexible options to enhance the surgical curricula. New techniques in imaging and surgery have made 3-dimensional anatomical knowledge an increasingly important goal of medical education. This study compared the efficacy of 2 supplemental, self-study methods for learning shoulder joint anatomy to determine which method provides for greater transfer of learning to the clinical setting.Two groups of medical students studied shoulder joint anatomy using either a second-generation virtual reality surgical simulator or images from a textbook. They were then asked to identify anatomical structures of the shoulder joint as they appeared in a videotape of a live arthroscopic procedure.The mean identification scores, out of a possible score of 7, were 3.1 +/- 1.3 for the simulator group and 2.9 +/- 1.5 for the textbook group (P = 0.70). Student ratings of the 2 methods on a 5-point Likert scale were significantly different. The simulator group rated the simulator more highly as an effective learning tool than the textbook group rated the textbook (means of 3.2 +/- 0.7 and 2.6 +/- 0.5, respectively, P = 0.02). Furthermore, the simulator group indicated that they were more likely to use the simulator as a learning tool if it were available to them than the textbook group was willing to use the textbook (means of 4.0 +/- 1.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.9, respectively, P = 0.02).Our results show that this surgical simulator is at least as effective as textbook images for learning anatomy and could enhance student learning through increased motivation. These findings provide insight into simulator development and strategies for learning anatomy. Possible explanations and future research directions are discussed. Formal evaluation of surgical simulators is essential before their introduction into training programs. We report our assessment of the Mentice Corp Procedicus shoulder arthroscopy simulator. This study tests the hypothesis of construct validity that experienced surgeons will score better on the simulator than individuals with minimal to no experience with the technique. Thirty-five subjects were stratified into three groups (novice, intermediate, and expert) based on their past 5 years' experience with shoulder arthroscopies. Each subject had an identical session on the simulator and completed anatomic identification, hook manipulations, and scope navigation exercises. We found statistically significant differences among the three groups in hook manipulation and scope navigation exercises, with the expert group performing the exercises more quickly (P =.013) and more accurately (P =.002) than the other two groups. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups in the identification of anatomic landmarks. Experts rated the simulator as an effective teaching tool, giving it a mean score of 4.22 and 4.44 (maximum, 5) for teaching instrument control and triangulation, respectively. The purpose of this article is to arthroscopically evaluate the effect of forearm rotation on scaphoid fracture displacement and the impact of intra-articular ligament sectioning.Controlled laboratory study.Scaphoid fracture stability is studied arthroscopically in 10 cadaveric upper limbs. Displacement of the osteotomized scaphoid with and without forearm rotation is arthroscopically evaluated before and after radioscaphocapitate (RSC) ligament sectioning.No rotation at the fracture site was identified in full pronation and full supination with the wrist immobilized. With the RSC ligament intact, no immobilization, and the wrist fully pronated, 25% of scaphoid fractures rotated less than 1 mm, 62.5% rotated 1 to 2 mm, and 12.5% rotated more than 2 mm. After sectioning the RSC ligament, the fully pronated wrist resulted in rotation of less than 1 mm in 75% and 1 to 2 mm in 25%. No rotation at the fracture site was seen with supination, with or without immobilization. No difference was found between loaded and unloaded trials.Based on this observational data, it appears safe to use a below-elbow thumb spica cast in the treatment of minimally displaced scaphoid waist fractures. Sectioning of the RSC ligament resulted in reduced amount of rotation at the scaphoid waist fracture; thus the RSC ligament may be a deforming force rather than a stabilizing force in scaphoid waist fractures. Arthroscopy may be a valuable tool in the study of the effect of ligament sectioning on fracture stability. Learning anatomy and surgical procedures requires both a conceptual understanding of three-dimensional anatomy and a hands-on manipulation of tools and tissue. Such virtual resources are not available widely, are expensive, and may be culturally disallowed. Simulation technology, using high-performance computers and graphics, permits realistic real-time display of anatomy. Haptics technology supports the ability to probe and feel this virtual anatomy through the use of virtual tools. The Internet permits world-wide access to resources. We have brought together high-performance servers and high-bandwidth communication using the Next Generation Internet and complex bimanual haptics to simulate a tool-based learning environment for wide use. This article presents the technologic basis of this environment and some evaluation of its use in the gross anatomy course at Stanford University. Dev, P., Heinrichs, W. L., Srivastava, S., Montgomery, K. N., Senger, S., Temkin, B., Hasser, C., Latombe, J. C., HEEGAARD, J., Youngblood, P., Friedman, C. P., Waldron, K. The Next Generation Internet (NGI) will provide high bandwidth, guaranteed Quality of Service, collaboration and security, features that are not available in today's Internet. Applications that take advantage of these features will need to build them into their pedagogic requirements. We present the Anatomy Workbench and the Surgery Workbench, two applications that require most of these features of the NGI. We used pedagogic need and NGI features to define a set of applications that would be difficult to operate on the current Internet, and that would require the features of the NGI. These applications require rich graphics and visualization, and extensive haptic interaction with biomechanical models that represent bony and soft tissue. We are in the process of implementing these applications, and some examples are presented here. An additional feature that we required was that the applications be scalable such that they could run on either on a low-end desktop device with minimal manipulation tools or on a fully outfitted high-end graphic computer with a realistic set of surgical tools. The Anatomy and Surgery Workbenches will be used to test the features of the NGI, and to show the importance of these new features for innovative educational applications. Pugh, C.

Towards this goal, we are studying two distinct processes. Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed, is an absolute requirement for tumour formation. One of our interests is understanding how tumors become vascularized and the mechanisms that can limit this process. Our focus is on the p53 tumour suppressor pathway and how it is able to inhibit angiogenesis. The p53 gene is mutated in half of all human cancers and at least part of its tumour suppression activity stems from inhibiting tumour vascularization. Angiogenesis is regulated through a balance of factors that either promote or inhibit vascularization. Studies from our group demonstrated that p53 stimulates the production of the potent angiogenesis inhibitors Endostatin and Tumstatin. Projects in the lab include the identification of novel p53-induced angiogenesis inhibitors and defining how such factors work. A variety of animal viruses have the ability to kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. Thus, discovering the mechanisms by which these viruses destroy cancer cells could potentially lead to novel pathways that can be exploited for therapy. We use the viral protein Apoptin from Chicken Anemia Virus as a model for understanding tumour-specific cell death. The Apoptin protein has the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis specifically in cancer cells. We demonstrated that Apoptin interacts with and inhibits a large protein complex called the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C is absolutely required for cells to progress through mitosis and been shown to be a cellular target of several human viruses including HTLV, Adenovirus and Papillomavirus. Projects in the lab seek to determine why the APC/C seems to be a general target of such a diverse range of viruses and how inhibition of this complex can lead to specific destruction of cancer cells.

Niles returned to MIT in 2007 to join the Department of Biological Engineering where his research group consists of Biological Engineers, Chemists, and Microbiologists focused on developing novel biomolecular tools to better enable the study of the malaria parasite The goal of the Niles lab is to establish, through technological innovations, new avenues to discovering fundamental malaria parasite biology that can be translated into much-needed diagnostic, preventative and therapeutic solutions. The lab\u2019s long-term goal is to create a diverse and easy-to-use molecular toolkit for robustly controlling gene expression and protein function, thereby enabling the efficient elucidation of parasite gene function. The lab emphasizes constructing tools that are multi-purpose and broadly applicable across different organisms, including model systems and especially less genetically tractable pathogens. In some instances, the lab tailors existing technologies to make them compatible with unique aspects of our target organism biology. Alternatively, the lab uses basic principles gleaned from nature to design and systematically develop novel strategies for achieving gene regulation. The Niles lab is also interested in quantitatively understanding the extent to which the parasite balances de novo heme biosynthesis with scavenging, as heme metabolism plays an important role in parasite biology. The lab is developing novel heme biosensors and using mass spectrometric and biochemical approaches to gain quantitative and dynamic information on how heme from different sources is utilized. Finally, the lab is interested in better understanding the pathophysiology of severe malarial disease. Specifically, it seeks further insight into how organ-specific distribution and burden of parasites interact to influence the likelihood of a severe malaria outcome, and whether dysfunction of a specific organ system correlates with these parameters. To address these questions, the lab is developing molecular probes to facilitate dynamic and quantitative molecular imaging of genetically unmodified parasites in the native host.

This feature represents the basis for its wide clinical use as a tumor marker. We have cloned genes coding for most of the family members in order to discern their normal functions and to determine the significance of their overexpression for cancer. We discovered that they function as intercellular adhesion molecules and suggested that, when inappropriately expressed at high levels in cells still capable of proliferation, they interfere with other cell surface interactions, leading to a distortion of tissue architecture and a to a block in terminal cellular differentiation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have shown that CEA expression can block the myogenic differentiation of rodent myoblasts and that this block can be released by peptides representing the adhesive domains of CEA. The cells are left in a quiescent state with continuous proliferation potential, and are particularly susceptible to the acquisition of further oncogenic lesions. It appears, therefore, that CEA-CEA interactions trigger a cellular response which contributes to malignancy. We have shown recently that other types of differentiation are also inhibited by CEA expression, including adipogenic, neuronal and, most importantly, human colonocyte differentiation. In the latter case, human colon cells transfected to overexpress CEA show a loss of cellular polarization and differentiation and a distortion of tissue architecture. In addition, a tissue architecture quality control mechanism known as anoikis, that kills cells not properly attached to their basement membranes by apoptosis, is inhibited. The molecular mechanism for these effects appears to involve a perturbation of integrin-substrate molecule interactions induced by CEA expression.

The Manalis laboratory develops quantitative and real-time techniques for biomolecular detection and single cell analysis. We use conventional silicon processing techniques to fabricate fluidic devices, and exploit the unique physical properties associated with micro- and nanoscale dimensions for developing precision measurement methods. The laboratory has developed a technology that enables mass to be measured in the aqueous environment with a resolution that is more than a million-fold better than existing methods. This approach, known as the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), places the fluid inside of the resonator instead of immersing the resonator in the fluid and thereby solves the long-standing problem of signal degradation from viscous drag. This has enabled single cells, nanoparticles and biomolecules to be weighed in solution with sub-femtogram resolution. The lab is currently exploring a wide range of biological applications with the SMR. For example, they are using the SMR's ability to resolve mammalian cell mass with a precision near ~0.01% to investigate how cell growth relates to progression through the division cycle, and if the response of cancer cells to pathway-directed therapeutics can be classified according to subtle changes in growth. The Manalis laboratory is also developing approaches for measuring physical properties of single cells with high precision and high throughput. Examples include: i) using intracellular water exchange for measuring changes in dry mass, water content and chemical composition of the cell, and ii) characterizing the deformability and surface friction of cancer cells. Ultimately, the ability to combine multi-parameter physical with molecular measurements at the single-cell level could not only be used to further understanding of important cellular processes such as malignant transformation but may also be used to increase the predictive power of clinical diagnostics.

Following two years of postdoctoral research at the M.R.C. Laboratory of Molecular Biology with Drs. Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick, he joined the faculty of the MIT Department of Biology. He was promoted to Professor in 1976, and in 1983 was appointed Founding Member of the new Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. In 1999 he also became Professor of Biological Engineering in the new MIT Department of Biological Engineering. He was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1986, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1987, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of Boston Children's Hospital, where he chairs the Board Research Committee. He is also the lead author of the textbook Molecular Cell Biology; the seventh edition was published in April 2012. During the 2004 calendar year he served as President of the American Society for Cell Biology. Dr. Lodish was a founder and scientific advisory board member of several biotech companies including Genzyme, Inc. and Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Since 2007 he has been the Founding Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, the group charged with oversight of the state's 10- year $1 billion investment in the life sciences. Over 170 MD, PhD, and MD/PhD students and fellows have trained in his laboratory; two of his trainees have received the Nobel Prize and six have been elected to the US National Academy of Sciences or the Institutes of Medicine. In 1988, the Lodish laboratory accomplished pioneering work on erythropoietin (Epo), the hormone that controls the production of red blood cells; the group identified and cloned the Epo receptor. This has led to a long and ongoing set of projects on the activation of and signal transduction by the erythropoietin receptor in erythroid progenitor cells, and the regulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and cell division during red cell formation. Currently they are characterizing many novel genes that are important for terminal stages of erythropoiesis, including chromatin condensation and enucleation. Other work focuses on the regulation of self- renewal, proliferation and differentiation of early (BFU-E) erythroid progenitor cells by extracellular signals including glucocorticoids and oxygen. This has led to the identification and characterization of several molecules, including six that are FDA-approved drugs for other indications, that show great promise as therapeutics for bone marrow failure disorders and erythropoietin- resistant anemias. This research involves extensive computational analyses of large datasets of gene expression profiles and chromatin modifications generated from cells at different stages of human and mouse red cell development. This research has led to the identification of may long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) that are specifically expressed in developing red blood cells and that regulate important aspects of their development, including cell death. Many remain in the nucleus, regulate expression of nearby genes, and appear to modify chromatin segments; these LncRNAs are a major current subject of lab research. Recently they identified and are characterizing lncRNAs specifically expressed in developing brown and white adipocytes and that are required for formation of these fat cells. Understanding the roles of these non-coding RNAs in health and in diseases such as diabetes are ongoing projects in the lab. Red blood cells are attractive vehicles for the introduction of novel therapeutics, immunomodulatory agents, and diagnostic imaging probes into the human body: They have a lifespan of 120 days and contain no DNA; any genes introduced into red cell precursors will no longer be present in the enucleated red cells introduced into a recipient. A large DARPA- supported project, in collaboration with Prof. Hidde Ploegh, involves the generation of human red blood cells in culture that have on their surface monoclonal antibodies that can inactivate a variety of toxic substances, or receptors that can bind and remove unwanted materials from the blood. Gene- modified red cells can be targeted to specific sites in the vasculature where they can deliver drugs or reagents or serve as imaging modalities. Sankaran, Vijay G., Leif S.

We focus on two ion channels, the AMPA and the NMDA type glutamate receptors. These receptors are multisubunited pores that admit cations into the postsynaptic cell when stimulated by glutamate. AMPA receptors function in fast excitatory transmission while NMDA receptors function in altering synaptic architecture and transmission strength. Both receptor types are composed of integral membrane protein subunits that project domains outside the cell and into the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic domains associate with binding proteins that serve as attachment sites to the cytoskeleton or to regulatory proteins (such as kinase or phosphatases) that modify receptor activity. We have cloned proteins which associate with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluR2 AMPA type glutamate receptor subunit and are studying the role of these binding factors in receptor control. One protein that binds to GluR2 is the chaperone, NSF. A second protein is AMPA Receptor Binding Protein (ABP). ABP may form a cytoplasmic scaffold that binds receptors at the synapse. We are testing a model that NSF regulates the attachment of GluR2 to ABP and other cytoplasmic factors. We are studying the role of the NMDA receptor in the control of the AMPA receptor.

She is also a Project Leader in the NCI Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) Center at the Broad Institute aimed at targeting causal cancer genes with small molecules. The Koehler lab is focused on building chemical tools and methods for studying temporal aspects of transcriptional regulation in development and disease with a focus on cancer. The lab pursues these goals by discovering and developing direct small-molecule probes of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation such as transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes. Transcription factors that become overactive in disease are promising yet untested targets for therapeutics. For example, these proteins mediate the excessive transcription of genes whose products are required for tumor growth and metastasis. Unlike enzymes, directly modulating the function of a transcription factor requires specific disruption or recruitment of DNA-protein or protein-protein interactions. The discovery or design of small molecules that specifically disrupt or promote these interactions has thus far been a significant challenge and the protein class is often perceived to be \u2018undruggable.\u2019 While a handful of successes have been published, the chemical biology community has yet to develop general and systematic strategies for directly modulating the function of transcription factors in cells using small molecules. Our team is developing a general approach to small-molecule probe discovery for transcription factors by coupling direct binding assays with functional assays involving transcriptional and other phenotypic readouts. For example, the group is pursuing compounds that bind and modulate various B-cell master regulators including c-Myc, NF-\u03baB and Pax5. The group also seeks to identify small-molecule probes of enzymes that regulate the acetylation status of these oncogenic transcription factors. Several transcription factors are non-histone substrates of chromatin modifying enzymes. The mechanistic consequences of acetylation status for transcription factors is not well understood but evidence suggests that these marks affect protein half-life and stable association with chromatin, among other functions. The lab has an interest in identifying small-molecule probes that distinguish between histone and non-histone substrates for deacetylases. The group uses a variety of biochemical and cellular approaches to identify compounds that serve as selective probes of function for specific HDACs or that selectively alter acetylation status of specific transcription factors in cells. Specifically, the lab has an interest in identifying allosteric probes of functions distinct from enzymatic activities, such as protein-protein interactions involving cofactors or other members of the transcriptional machinery.

In addition to embryonic development, we aim to reveal the spatial and conditional aspects of gene regulatory pathways by studying an organ (the human pancreas), tumorigenesis (zebrafish melanoma), and host-pathogen interaction (human Salmonella), through a collaborative approach that will also include the development of novel methods for spatial transcriptomics.

After two years of postdoctoral research at the University of California at San Diego, he joined MIT as Assistant Professor of Applied Biochemistry in 1979. The Klibanov group has discovered the rules that enable enzymes to vigorously act as catalysts in organic solvents containing little or no water. When placed in this unnatural milieu, enzymes acquire some remarkable novel properties, such as greatly enhanced thermostability and strikingly different specificity, including stereoselectivity. The ultimate goal is to obtain a mechanistic understanding of enzymatic catalysis in nonaqueous media. This knowledge will enable us to control predictably the behavior of enzymes by altering the solvent, rather than the protein molecule itself (as in protein engineering). Enzymes in organic solvents are also used as catalysts of synthetically interesting and challenging processes, such as asymmetric oxidoreductions. The Klibanov group\u2019s recent studies have resulted in a new, \u201cnon-release\u201d strategy for rendering common materials (plastics, glass, textiles) permanently microbicidal. This strategy, involving covalent attachment of certain long, moderately hydrophobic polycations to material surfaces, has been proven to be very effective against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and fungi, both airborne and waterborne. This work continues along with a quest for creating material coatings with anti-viral and anti-sporal activities. In order to be therapeutically useful, drugs have to be stable and bioavailable. Unfortunately, macromolecular pharmaceuticals are lacking in both respects. The aim is to elaborate the mechanism-based approaches to overcoming these obstacles. For example, recently the Klibanov group has undertaken a systematic investigation of the effect of selective chemical modifications of polyethylenimine (PEI) on its efficiency as a vector for plasmid DNA delivery into mammalian cells. As a result, PEI\u2019s derivatives have been discovered with both far greater transfection efficiency and lower toxicity than those of the parent polymer (considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d in non-viral gene delivery vehicles).

Dewhirst, DVM, PhD is the Gustavo S. Montana Professor of Radiation Oncology and Vice Director for Basic Science in the Duke Cancer Institute. Dr. Dewhirst has research interests in tumor hypoxia, angiogenesis, hyperthermia and drug transport. He has spent 30 years studying causes of tumor hypoxia and the use of hyperthermia to treat cancer. In collaboration with Professor David Needham in the Pratt School of Engineering, he has developed a novel thermally sensitive drug carrying liposome that has been successfully translated to human clinical trials. He has utilized the thermal characteristics of this liposome to develop an MR imageable form that can accurately reflect drug concentrations in tumors, which then is related to the extent of anti-tumor effect in pre-clinical models. This property has been widely used by other investigators, world-wide, particularly in the area of high intensity focused ultrasound, where it would be possible to literally paint drug to a target zone and visualize this process in real time, during heating. For his work in this area, Dr. Dewhirst was named a Fellow in the AAAS. Dr. Dewhirst has well over 500 peer-reviewed publications, book chapters and reviews, with >20,000 citations and an H-index of 73.

Towards this goal, we are studying two distinct processes. Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed, is an absolute requirement for tumour formation. One of our interests is understanding how tumors become vascularized and the mechanisms that can limit this process. Our focus is on the p53 tumour suppressor pathway and how it is able to inhibit angiogenesis. The p53 gene is mutated in half of all human cancers and at least part of its tumour suppression activity stems from inhibiting tumour vascularization. Angiogenesis is regulated through a balance of factors that either promote or inhibit vascularization. Studies from our group demonstrated that p53 stimulates the production of the potent angiogenesis inhibitors Endostatin and Tumstatin. Projects in the lab include the identification of novel p53-induced angiogenesis inhibitors and defining how such factors work. A variety of animal viruses have the ability to kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. Thus, discovering the mechanisms by which these viruses destroy cancer cells could potentially lead to novel pathways that can be exploited for therapy. We use the viral protein Apoptin from Chicken Anemia Virus as a model for understanding tumour-specific cell death. The Apoptin protein has the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and p53-independent apoptosis specifically in cancer cells. We demonstrated that Apoptin interacts with and inhibits a large protein complex called the Anaphase Promoting Complex\/Cyclosome (APC\/C). The APC\/C is absolutely required for cells to progress through mitosis and been shown to be a cellular target of several human viruses including HTLV, Adenovirus and Papillomavirus. Projects in the lab seek to determine why the APC\/C seems to be a general target of such a diverse range of viruses and how inhibition of this complex can lead to specific destruction of cancer cells.

The viral protein Apoptin associates with the anaphase-promoting complex to induce G2\/M arrest and apoptosis in the absence of p53.

vitamin folic acid is essential to the production of purines and thymidylate required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Of special importance is the role of folate in providing sufficient amounts of adenosylmethionine required for more than a hundred different methylation reactions fundamental to a wide range of metabolic functions. All these processes are particularly important to rapidly dividing cells in any tissue. Recently, folate status and its metabolic functions have been shown to relate to the incidence of atherosclerosis in adults and to neural tube defects in children. It has been shown that folate supplements to women, begun prior to conception, decrease the incidence of neural tube defects in babies by up to 66%, but the way in which this is achieved metabolically is unclear; does it relate to nucleotides, methylation, gene(s) expression, polymorphism in a gene(s) or some other process? My laboratory has been investigating several aspects of folate-mediated processes: both the mitochondria and the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have folate-dependent functions, but their roles are not clearly understood, especially as regards the mitochondrial compartment. We demonstrated over-expression of a bifunctional folate enzyme in the mitochondria of tumour cells and showed that it is highly expressed in fetal but not in normal adult tissues. We postulate that it may have a role in fetal development and\/or mitochondrial biogenesis and perhaps relates to neural tube defects. Gene disruption experiments in mammalian cells in culture have been performed to understand the role of this enzyme and others in the two cellular compartments. Using these cells we have recently obtained mice with one of the nuclear alleles encoding the mitochondrial protein inactivated. A breeding program with these mice demonstrated that the null mutant mice die in utero at about day 13 of development, apparently due to a defect in the ability of the fetal liver to establish hematopoesis. We are currently working with cell lines from mutants and wild type to delineate possible metabolic consequences of the gene deletion. Many of the folate-dependent enzymes are multifunctional, having more than one catalytic activity per polypeptide. One of our goals has been to understand the benefits of this type of structure to its function in mammalian cells. My laboratory has cloned and expressed several such enzymes and have X-ray crystallographic structure of the bifunctional enzyme that uses NADP. The objectives are to understand the mechanism of the enzyme(s) using site-directed mutagenesis, assisted by 3-D structure, to assign functions to key amino acid residues. to understand the unique replacement of NADP by NAD, Mg and phosphate by the enzyme expressed in fetal mitochondria and tumour cells. Re-introducing the cDNA that encodes these mutant proteins having altered properties into the gene-disrupted mammalian cells then provides a vehicle to test hypotheses of metabolic function.","university":"McGill University","research_area_score":0.69364838,"keywords":"[German part, European Patent, collagen, type, transgenic animals, Uses, K.M.C.

Natural and synthetic analogs of these substances are used extensively to control a broad spectrum of human diseases including cancer. The effects of each hormone depend primarily on a protein referred to as a receptor. The study of these receptors is important to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular response to these inducers. This is a group of novel steroid hormone-like receptors for which the ligands remain unknown. Our research program in this area is aimed at identifying novel hormones and the function of their receptors during development, homeostasis and in cancer cells. The research endeavors of my laboratory in this area are directed toward understanding the molecular basis of vitamin A action. We are generating genetically altered mouse strains to study the role of retinoid receptors in cancer progression. These studies should improve our basic knowledge of retinoid physiology and lead to a better understanding of the role of retinoids in suppressing the development of neoplastic cells. Perhaps one of the most exciting long-term hopes in breast cancer treatment is that a better understanding of the role of hormones in mammary differentiation, such as that which occurs during mammary gland development and potentially protects against breast cancer, will lead to new effective strategies in breast cancer prevention and treatment. Thus, our research is directed at improving our knowledge of the roles of estradiol, an ovarian hormone implicated in the growth and proliferation of normal and abnormal mammary cells. Using approaches, our current objectives are to study the signaling pathways implicated in the activation of its two receptors (alpha and beta) during mammary gland development. It is hoped that our molecular and genetic analysis of orphan nuclear receptors, retinoid action and estrogen receptors will lead to an increase in our understanding of these hormone-based systems which, in turn, will help develop more efficient therapy for treatment of cancer.","university":"McGill University","research_area_score":0.3003851961,"keywords":"[-2013, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, University, Medicine, LKS Faculty, Student Affairs, Academic Networking, Assistant Dean, grants, M, M internal grants, HK$, M external grants, HK$, Project No, models, NAFLD, disease, polysaccharides, Lycium, Wolfberry, Therapeutic effects, HMRF, HK$, Project no.17156516, disease, cyclooxygenase-1, role, RGC, General Research Fund, mice, injury, CCl4)-induced, tetrachloride, fibrosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, EGCG, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, A.A., Nanji, M.L., Fung, T.Y.H., Lau, E.C., Liong, T.M., Leung, kappa B pathways, NF, FoxO1, Akt, PI3 K, SMAD, TGF, model, disease, non, inflammation, oxidative stress, fibrosis, Epigallocatechin gallate, apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, imbalance, lipid dysfunction, pathways, my research, precise therapeutic management, NAFLD, development, exact mechanism, cancer, syndrome, factors, NAFLD, benefits, proven therapeutic mechanisms, effects, its wide availability, attentions, NAFLD, herbal treatment, application, past decades, liver, pathological events, potential therapeutic strategy, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, dysfunction, resistance, occurrence, NAFLD, Pathogenesis, syndrome, symptoms, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, other pathological conditions, world, injury, causes, NAFLD, NAFLD, disease, diseases, oxidative stress, inflammation, M30, functional drugs, phytochemical agents, medicinal herbs, antioxidants, role, my work, liver, oxidative stress, hypoxia, inflammation, mechanisms, interest]","phd_school_rank":41.0,"phd_school_rank_diff":9.0,"phd_school_score":0.8163265306,"promotion_year_diff":null,"promotion_year_score":null,"phd_year_diff":3.0,"phd_year_score":0.9189189189,"final_score":0.6785435486},"381":{"department":"Biochemistry","name":"Mary A Schuler","phd_school":"Unknown","phd_year":1981,"position":"Professor","profile_link":"http:\/\/mcb.illinois.edu\/faculty\/profile\/maryschu\/","promotion_year":2010,"tag":"aspirant","text_raw":"From structural perspectives, plant and insect cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are membrane-bound proteins sharing high conservation in their secondary and tertiary folding patterns with the membrane-bound forms found in vertebrates and soluble forms found in bacteria. Embedded within the external skeleton formed by higher order \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-pleated sheet structures, the internal catalytic sites in various P450s are defined by a series of varying length loop sequences (designated as substrate recognition sequences (SRS)) that specify the size of the catalytic site and orientation of compounds over the catalytic heme. In the correct orientation and in proximity to the catalytically important I-helix, substrates incorporate the heme-bound oxygen through a reaction cycle that utilizes electrons transferred from P450 reductase and cytochrome b . In the incorrect orientation, inhibitors position themselves within the catalytic site, block the reaction cycle and interfere with substrate oxygenation. From biochemical perspectives, the ability to incorporate oxygen at very specific points in a substrate\u2019s structure is essential to numerous synthetic and catabolic pathways that utilize simple alkyl and aromatic hydroxylations or more complex epoxidations, aryl migrations, decarboxylations and carbon-carbon bond cleavages. Because of the involvement of P450s in many critical metabolic conversions, the restricted substrate specificity of many plant and insect monooxygenases and the chemical versatility of the entire group of monoxygenases have generated significant interest in defining functions for those not yet characterized, in understanding catalytic site constraints of those in biologically important pathways and in modifying them for crop improvement and biopharmaceutical production. From genomics and evolutionary perspectives, these types of goals are especially challenging since plant P450 gene families have duplicated and diverged to unprecedented degrees as new pathways have evolved for the synthesis of plant defense toxins and other secondary metabolites. From functional and transcriptional perspectives, these goals are also challenged by the fact that closely related P450s sometimes vary in only a few catalytic site residues affecting their substrate specificities and their genes may vary in only a few promoter elements affecting their expression patterns. Our research projects in this area are focused on defining the functions and structures of a variety of plant P450s with biological roles important in the production of defense toxins, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids and signaling molecules as well as insect P450s with biological roles in the destruction of plant defense toxins and synthetic insecticides. With many P450s being integral to the synthetic and detoxicative functions in these organisms, we have sought to better define the biochemical parameters dictating the substrate specificities of individual P450s, the molecular programs defining their transcriptional responses to internal and external cues and the genomic events enabling their acquisition of novel biochemical functions. Bringing together structural, biochemical and genomics perspectives into a comprehensive view of each P450 being studied, we have focused on developing and interfacing computational and biochemical technologies important for understanding, defining and manipulating P450 functions, irrespective of their plant, insect or vertebrate origin. Stepping beyond the phylogenetic primary sequence alignments most frequently used to assign P450 nomenclature, we have developed and improved molecular modeling protocols allowing us to more accurately predict three-dimensional structures for plant and insect P450s based on available mammalian P450 crystal structures (Baudry et al., 2006; Rupasinghe and Schuler, 2006). We have also developed low-throughput and high-throughput docking procedures for predictions of a compound\u2019s binding mode within various catalytic sites. Interfacing computational predictions of protein structure and substrate binding mode with biochemical reality, we have optimized several heterologous expression systems for production of P450s, P450 reductase and cytochrome b (Duan and Schuler, 2006) and utilized these for defining biochemical functions of individual P450s. Among our available systems, baculovirus-mediated insect cell expression has been used for substrate binding and activity analyses, inhibitor analyses and scaled-up product characterizations, yeast expression has been used for substrate activity analyses and metabolic engineering, and bacterial expression has been used for metabolic engineering and scaled-up production for crystallization trials and isotopic labelings. Our biochemical analyses, which are tied back to computational predictions and forward to evolutionary analyses, support our structure predictions by generating and testing numerous catalytic site, proximal surface and membrane anchor mutants. Together, these data have provided for very thorough appreciations of the catalytic site and proximal surface residues modulating P450 activities and substrate ranges. Incorporating these computational and biochemical perspectives with the genomics perspectives needed to understand the physiological roles of specific P450s, we have used a variety of techniques to detail and manipulate a range of plant P450 transcripts expressed in response to abiotic and biotic stresses and insect P450 transcripts expressed in response to natural and synthetic toxins. Providing perspective on the types of biological systems that we are currently studying, these include: P450s have focused on defining biochemical and physiological functions for the subfamilies mediating metabolisms of fatty acids, phenylpropanoids and defense toxins. Molecular modeling, substrate docking and biochemical analysis have allowed us to detail the catalytic site conservations and differences between members of the CYP86 and CYP94 families that modulate hydroxylations on nonoxygenated vs. oxygenated fatty acids (Rupasinghe et al., 2007) and members of the CYP98A subfamily that modulate hydroxylations on lignin precursors. Biochemical analyses tied to functional analyses of T-DNA knockouts have allowed us to describe the developmental and stress-related effects of inactivating particular P450 transcripts defined previously in microarray analyses, we have begun analyzing the circadian fluctuations of individual genes to determine the range of P450 transcripts affected by the circadian clock and the extent to which stress signaling cascades swamp normal cyclical variations. Our analyses have demonstrated that many P450 transcripts in the flavonoid, carotenoid, brassinosteroid, jasmonate and glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways are circadian-regulated (Pan et al., 2009), including several capable of responding to jasmonic acid and other biotic stress signaling molecules. Transcript analyses at varying times in the circadian cycle have shown that, for several P450 genes, the magnitudes of their inducibilities change throughout the day in response to stress signaling molecules indicating that the responses of some biosynthetic pathways vary with and, sometimes, supercede the circadian cycle. Bioinformatics analysis has allowed us to identify over-represented promoter motifs in those responding to both circadian and stress signaling cues and these are being tested for functionality (honey bee) have focused on identifying those capable of detoxifying natural plant toxins and understanding their relationships to those detoxifying synthetic insecticides. Our work with many of these insect P450s combines expression in heterologous systems with molecular modeling to predict and define the range of compounds metabolized by individual P450 sequences and to determine the effects of allelic variations on catalytic activities toward various classes of plant compounds and insecticides. These analyses have provided concrete evidence for the convergent evolution of P450s involved in the detoxification of plant compounds and insecticides (Li et al., 2004, 2007; Rupasinghe et al., 2007; Chiu et al., 2008) and highlighted the importance of avoiding repeated insecticide selections. For others, these analyses have provided evidence for selective evolution in some P450 catalytic sites that have restricted access to the heme oxygen and directed metabolism toward highly select groups of plant toxins or that have varied proximal surface residues to enhance interactions with critical electron transfer partners needed for activity (Mao et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). CYP6Z subfamily, which are over-expressed in insecticide-resistant stock strains, have provided information on a range of catalytic site and proximal surface changes that have potential to affect enzymatic functions. In conjunction with these studies, we are using high-throughput computational screening to identify inhibitors for several P450s capable of metabolizing insecticides and likely to mediate the acquisition of insecticide resistance in various mosquito populations. Other projects have begun characterizing the small collection of 46 honey bee P450s and identified several in the expanded CYP6AS subfamily that metabolize quercitin, the main flavonoid in honey and pollen (Mao et al., 2009). Several involved in the metabolism of the insecticide tau-fluvalinate have also been identified. Projects in biopharmaceutically-important P450s are focused on identifying plant P450s and their associated proteins involved in the synthesis of important anti-cancer and anti-viral alkaloids in , two medicinal plants. With many parts of the complex alkaloid synthetic pathways in these plants containing P450s whose protein expression characteristics have not yet been tested in bacterial and yeast systems, we have begun cloning and optimizing expression of components in the early and late alkaloid pathways. Protein candidates for these components are being identified by bioinformatic and computational assessments of transcriptome profiles that have recently become available for these medicinal plants. With structural and biochemical analyses of individual candidates completed, future projects with our collaborators will focus on engineering of complete pathways in yeast and bacteria. Projects in this area are focused on coupling molecular modeling, protein expression and solid-state NMR capabilities to define the backbone structures for plant and human P450s. For these, full-length P450s (including their hydrophobic membrane anchor) are expressed in E. coli under conditions suitable for uniformly-labeling proteins with N amino acids. Interfacing of scored molecular models with experimental solid-state NMR data has provided us and our collaborators with the ability to discriminate between good and bad P450 models and to significantly enhance structure determinations from solid-state NMR datasets. Projects in this area are focused on defining the range of splicing factors mediating constitutive and alternative splicing during plant growth and development. Using T-DNA knockout\/knockout lines and RNA silencing lines depleted for different classes of splicing factors, we have been characterizing the roles of a number of second-step splicing factors as well as general splicing factors. We are particularly interested in the second-step splicing factors since they are encoded by multiple divergent genes that have potential to differentially regulate splicing, in contrast to those in yeast and humans that are encoded by single genes. Additional projects have begun to examine the stress responses of the second-step splicing factors and to determine whether some of these alter splice site choices in the stressed plant cells. acting factors involved in the recognition of plant AU rich introns and, in the long run, help define the optimal sequences needed to express transgenes and transgenic proteins in heterologous plants.

Functional characterization of the FLCN-AMPK pathway in cancer - The Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 (BHD) syndrome is a hereditary human cancer syndrome that predisposes affected individuals to develop renal carcinoma of nearly all subtypes, as well as benign fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary, colon and renal cysts, caused by loss of-function mutations in the FLCN gene. FLCN was identified as an AMPK binding partner, and we demonstrated that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of AMPK. Loss of FLCN constitutively activated AMPK, resulting in PGC-1\u03b1-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, increased ROS production, which induced HIF transcriptional activity and drove Warburg metabolic reprogramming. This reprogramming stimulated cellular bioenergetics and conferred a HIF-dependent tumorigenic advantage in FLCN-negative cancer cells. Moreover, using Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells, we showed that loss of FLCN results in constitutive AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy, inhibition of apoptosis, enhanced cellular bioenergetics, and resistance to energy-depleting stresses including oxidative stress, heat, anoxia, and serum deprivation. We further showed that AMPK activation conferred by FLCN loss is independent of the cellular energy state suggesting that FLCN controls the AMPK energy sensing ability. Together, our data suggest that FLCN is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of AMPK signaling that acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AMPK function. We are now studying the mechanism of FLCN inhibition with respect to AMPK sensing activity as well as the effect of FLCN loss and AMPK activation in tumor progression in various human cancers. 2) Role of ESCRT component HD-PTP\/PTPN23 in cancer - Components of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) have long been proposed to act as tumor suppressors. PTPN23 or HD-PTP, an ESCRT associated protein, is located on 3p21.3, a region frequently deleted in many human malignancies. Previously, we have demonstrated that HD-PTP is a catalytically inactive PTP due to an evolutionary conserved divergence in its phosphatase domain. Using a mouse model we showed that HD-PTP is expressed in all epithelial tissues and that homozygous deletion of Ptpn23 is embryonic lethal at day 9.5. We are now characterizing various cancer phenotypes in this mouse model to elucidate the function of HD-PTP in tumorigenesis. We are also studying the effect of HD-PTP depletion on cell surface receptor trafficking, by elucidating the molecular determinants of endocytosed receptors targeting for recycling or lysosomal delivery such as receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination. ESCRT machinery is responsible for lysosomal targeting of ubiquitinated receptors, which leads to their signal abrogation.

Our major focus is cytochrome c oxidase, and we have developed as a model system a His-tagged form of yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, a system which allows for the first time the genetic manipulation of both nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded subunits. Translational projects, in collaborations with clinicians at UCH, Hammersmith and Royal Free Hospitals, are aimed at exploiting the rapid technical advances of mid-infrared spectroscopy to provide new medical diagnostic tools. One major project is screening of urine samples for various kidney diseases that are difficult or expensive to diagnose with current clinical methods. This has already led to our installing an experimental IR spectrometer in the Urology clinic of RFH for a three year data collection programme.

The specific focus of the lab is on the antigen-specific receptor expressed by T lymphocytes (T cell receptor, TCR). The TCR is an \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimer that recognizes foreign peptides that are bound to products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Foreign peptides can be derived from viral or bacterial antigens or in some cases from tumor associated antigens. For example, cytotoxic T cells recognize and kill tumor cells that express on their surface peptides bound to class I products of the MHC. Down regulation of the peptide\/class I complex is one mechanism that tumor cells use to escape recognition and destruction. It has also become clear that the aberrant reactivities of some \u03b1&beta TCRs can have severe autoimmune consequences. Rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are two examples of diseases that involve the activity of T cells. Studies of the molecular processes involved in the expression of the \u03b1\u03b2 TCR and the biochemical interactions between the TCR and its ligands are essential to understanding and eventually controlling such detrimental responses. A complete understanding of T cell recognition will require knowledge about the binding properties of T cell receptors. Unfortunately, the major limitation to such biochemical analyses has been the lack of pure receptor protein. Our lab has engineered a \"single-chain receptor\" gene (scTCR) that contains the V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 genes from a T cell clone linked by a gene that encodes a flexible peptide. The scTCR has been overexpressed in 27 kD) has been identified. Our goals are to use these recombinant proteins to: 1) evaluate the binding affinities and specificities of the TCR, 2) use site-directed mutagenesis to map the binding site of the TCR, and 3) correlate the energy of TCR-peptide\/MHC interactions with biological function. In another project, the TCR has been displayed on the surface of yeast cells. The yeast display system has been used to evolve more stable forms of the soluble TCR and to evolve TCR with higher affinities for their ligands. These high affinity TCRs have been used 1) to study the relationship between T cell function and TCR:ligand binding kinetics, 2) as probes for the presence of peptide-MHC complexes on tumor cells, 3) to inhibit undesirable T cell activity, and 4) to elucidate the structural contributions of different interactions to binding affinity. Finally, our lab is interested in engineering other proteins of immunological interest. These include the class I and class II MHC proteins, NK receptors, and antibodies against various T cell surface molecules. Proteins engineered for greater stability and higher affinity will be used to examine various structural and biochemical properties of the proteins, in addition to develop possible novel therapeutic agents.

Head of Through my research I contribute to a better understanding of the driving mechanisms, spatial complexity and environmental impacts of climate variability, on historic and prehistoric timescales. My primary expertise lies in tephrochronology. I have worked widely across Europe and Africa using far-traveled volcanic ash (tephra) layers as isochrons to align archives and test the pacing of regional climatic and environmental transitions. In particular, I am interested in the role of changing climates and environments on hominin evolution and dispersal during the Late Pleistocene, and on historical societies in more recent times. By using tephra layers to directly connect archaeological archives to the palaeoenvironmental record, precise correlations between climatic changes and human histories can be made. Much of my current research focuses on building Late Quaternary tephrostratigraphies for volcanic regions of the East African Rift. Through the characterisation and correlation of visible and non-visible (crypto-) tephra layers in lake sediment archives, detailed stratified tephra records are contributing both to dating and correlation of important tropical palaeoclimate archives and to a better understanding of past volcanism and hazard in an understudied region. ; one of the leading bodies in palaeoclimate research. INTIMATE aims to reconstruct past abrupt and extreme climate changes over the last glacial cycle, through the precise INTegration of Ice-core, MArine, and TErrestrial records, on their own independent timescales. The combined data is used in climate models to better understand the mechanisms and impact of change, thereby reducing the uncertainty of future prediction. Research into the timing, cause and impacts of tropical megadrought events recorded in the sediments of East African Lake Challa, a 90 m deep crater lake on the flank of Kilimanjaro. Lake Challa contains an exceptional sedimentary record, with the proven potential to reconstruct past hydroclimate at high chronological precision and with dating accuracy not previously achieved in the tropics. The wider ICDP project on Lake Challa will study tropical hydroclimate and ecosystem development throughout the full ~250,000 year sediment record. Visible and non-visible tephra layers will be characterised and dated throughout the core, contributing to a high precision chronology and a first continuous tephrostratigraphic archive for the region. , Chew Bahir lies between the Ethiopian and Omo-Turkana Rifts and will provide a detailed record palaeoclimate for the Middle - Late Pleistocene.
